Snazzy luxury and great staff -- still working out the offerings,40,Date of stay: June 2023,"Impressive modernity with many bells and whistles. Staff attentive and competent. Breakfast buffet amazing. Two offerings comments: the pool was a small plunge pool (more like a large bathtub), and they were cagey about open restaurants (the one still in reviews was closed for renovations). Worth a change from the typical high-end hotels in older buildings.",209
Avoid this hotel,20,Date of stay: October 2023,No way this is a 5 star hotel. Ugly design. Tiny rooms. Pictures are highly deceptive. Pool is tiny. Spa is low quality. Silly expensive for what you get. Then they used a ridiculous exchange rate when converting from EUR to USD when billing me.,2
Great hotel!,50,Date of stay: September 2023,The hotel was in a convenient location to what we planned on doing throughout our trip. Hotel staff was very friendly and the hotel itself was clean. Our room was spacious and comfortable. The fitness center is everything you could ask for in a hotel and gym and then some! We would definitely stay here again if our travels bring us back to Naples.,10
Artistic Elegance,50,Date of stay: October 2023,"Nothing but the best ambiance, decor, comfort, and amenities coupled with hip art throughout the facility. The concierge was friendly and helpful and the breakfast top notch with delicious fresh pastries. We spoiled ourselves and enjoyed every minute!",1
Nice Place,50,Date of stay: October 2023,Overall beautiful property with very helpful staff. Location is perfect to explore Naples. Price is very high but for Naples we are glad we splurged and saw as much as we did. The ferry launch to Capri was literally right in front of the property,1
Did not live up to expectations,20,Date of stay: September 2023,"I was eager and excited about staying at this hotel. The photos online looked amazing. The front desk staff was exceptional, however the rest of the wait staff continuously underperformed and 8 out of 10 times got our bar orders wrong. The pool area was pitiful. The lobby and hotel itself looked nice but it was sadly a case of looks are deceiving.",1
Not one bit of storage space.,30,Date of stay: September 2023,"The hotel is lovely and the people on the staff were helpful and very pleasant. But the room size and room accommodations were terrible. There was two small drawers for our clothes in the closet so you must live out of your suitcase. Then, there was no room to store the suitcases, and so they were in our way in the small hallway every time we had to leave the room. Folded clothes and paraphernalia had to be left all over the table and desk, so the room always looked messy. We had a view looking over Mt. Vesuvius which was very lovely. At least this gave us the feeling of more space.",1
Lovely hotel in so-so location,50,Date of stay: September 2023,"Spa wonderful. Best massage I ever had. Two hours each day in pools and heat rooms included. We used them every day. Michelin star restaurant was gracious, lovely and reasonable. Location near harbor a bit iffy but I’m not sure where in Naples would be better",6
Comfort and Convenience with Artsy Flair in Naples,50,Date of stay: June 2023,"Deserves high praise for convenience, cleanliness and interesting decor with warm hospitality and smiling service. Taking a return flight to NY through Naples after visiting the Puglia region, an easy drive to, we decided to spend a couple of days in this vibrant city.",73
Great hotel in Naples,40,Date of stay: July 2023,"The staff was friendly. The rooms are clean and modern. The spa with the salt room was one of our favorite things here. Easy walking to everything. The hotel is a stark contrast to Naples...clean, modern, a great place to end your day.",1
"Pricey, but nice",50,Date of stay: September 2023,"We stayed at Romeo Napoli towards the end of our honeymoon. The deluxe front room was quite nice, with nice amenities and the most comfortable bed we stayed in during our 2 week visit to Italy. The room itself had a lot of ""smart"" features, which took a moment to figure out, but was great. The location is adjacent to the port and walking distance to the cruise terminal. We were in Ischia prior to arriving in Napoli, and the close proximity was excellent. Please note that this is a pretty industrial port. You're not going to have a Positano-esque view from your room. That said, the view in the breakfast area was pretty cool. We watched a thunderstorm roll in up there. Seeing some lightning strike around Vesuvio felt like something out of Roman mythology. The staff was very…",7
Very happy I made this choice,50,Date of stay: September 2023,If you are going to stay here book a junior corner suite. The hotel is beautifully appointed. Slightly quirky in some of its decor in common areas. The people at reception are happy and smiling all the time. Breakfast is excellent. The pool is small but fine if you want to take a dip. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again. The surrounding area is a bit rough but there are great restaurants on the doorstep.,15
Pretentious and poor service,10,Date of stay: September 2023,"I normally would not submit a bad review, but most of the employees at this hotel were incredibly pretentious and rude and the drink and door service was very poor, which is a shame since the breakfast food was great. The 90EUR credit they offered seemed great, but then at 30EUR for a 4oz glass of wine it feels like a scam. We were so put off, we decided not to eat in their 1 Michelin Star restaurant, which they were quick to tell us about again and again. Someone should be reconsidering their Michelin Star.",64
Worth the $,50,Date of stay: September 2023,"The room was nice, the hotel staff was great- especially Andrea- he was very helpful and made some great recommendations for us. Being able to use the spa facilities was a huge plus, especially after flying in and with any down time we had. Breakfast was really good . Would stay here again.",13
Cozy like a railroad flat,30,Date of stay: September 2023,"The staff is super, no complaint there. The food was wonderful, both breakfast an a snack at the bar, so no complaint there. The location is a bit funky but extremely convenient to everything we choose to do. So again no complaint there. So why the three stars instead of four or five? The architect/designer clearly never spent a night at his creation. The rooms are cruise ship small. The closet space could not accommodate our reasonable amount of clothing. We kept our belongings in our luggage for the most part. There were only two small drawers for clothing. Oh and nowhere to store your luggage. They lined our narrow entry alleyway. The number of times I stubbed my toe or wacked my shin in the six days of our stay were in the high two figures. But you can’t open the teeny…",78
Birthday trip,50,Date of stay: August 2023,"Fabulous hotel. It’s not perhaps the prettiest location overlooking a busy port, but we loved it. Harbour view room - 507- watching cruise ships, ferries, hydrofoils etc. Room is compact but super comfy. Breakfast on 9th floor is fab - excellent staff. Lovely pool - it’s not big but it’s a city hotel. It’s a super chic hotel with excellent staff. The one negative comment would be - be careful when you order drinks! We did get a surprise which put us off a bit. Also amazing spa/gym. Also birthday celebration and were presented with the most amazing tasting cake at breakfast & the birthday boy said best ever cake he’s eaten. Wow - it was amazing",95
Wonderful hotel!,50,Date of stay: August 2023,"Absolutely amazing hotel! The area is eh, but the staff, the facilities, the breakfast, everything was so great. If you have to spend a night in Napoli, I would absolutely recommend this hotel. Chiara, I believe the manager, was extremely accommodating and helpful!",8
"Terrific hotel, facilities, people",50,Date of stay: July 2023,"Had a wonderful stay with the family. Rezervations and front office staff arranged all our plans for site visits and trips in the area. Fabulous design and art. Very central High quality in everything; people, rooms, food, experience From reservations, reception, concierge, bellboys, waiters, to housekeeping, everyone very competent and professional Our children who are basically adults now were very happy as well. Adult and quiet place - Might not be ideal for young children Would visit other properties if they open them Would come back again",1
"Great location, great gym, excellent pastry!",40,Date of stay: July 2023,"The breakfast buffet has great pastries - sfogliatella, Roman cream bun, mini strawberry tarts and the list goes on. For us, this was the highlight. With a Michelin star restaurant we expected the pastry to be good and we weren’t disappointed! The coffee is well made and tastes good. With all that eating, we were so pleased to see this hotel had a large, very well equipped gym. The gym contains techno gym equipment and proper weights! It’s one of the best gyms we have visited at a five star hotel in Italy. The reception and downstairs staff are friendly. We thought the location was great. It’s easy to walk around the centre of Naples and the hotel faces the harbor where the big cruise ships dock. One small thing - one morning we had breakfast around 9.30am and it was very…",299
Hotel Romeo saved the trip!,50,Date of stay: July 2023,"Hotel Romeo was a bit out of our price range so we didn’t originally book here. My sister and I were traveling through Europe for 3 weeks and Naples was the last stop. After checking in at another hotel where it did not live up to its photos in many ways and also didn’t uphold the marina view room price we booked, we called Hotel Romeo. They had limited rooms left but were able to work with us on finding a room for three nights. It was absolutely perfect. Amazing location, tremendous hospitality from beginning to end. Close to the ferry as we spent a day in Capri. Spa was really wonderful..one of my best massages ever. The breakfast was divine and pool area spotless. Would stay again in a heart beat. Special shout out to Stefania at the front desk who was our “go to” got…",3
A marvelously run hotel,50,Date of stay: July 2023,"It was a real pleasure to stay at this hotel. The staff is outstanding and always shows great warmth and professionalism. They go out of their way to be helpful in every way possible. The location is excellent. While facing the port with the huge cruise ships would not be my choice, the location is so central to all the major sites in the city. The breakfasts were excellent. I did not dine in their fine -dining restaurant. There is a small pool with a great view of the harbor. Thank you to the entire staff for making my stay so very enjoyable.",427
Stay elsewhere,10,Date of stay: June 2023,"The only reason I picked this hotel is because I’m a globalist with Hyatt. This however is not a typical Hyatt. They do not provide any of the same perks. We called a few days before our arrival and asked about early check in and they told us we needed to book another night. I truly disliked this hotel and the manager. We had an issue with one of the rooms and the manager was completely unaccommodating and arrogant. This was supposedly a five star hotel, and it had none of the characteristics. The rooms were clean, I’ll give it that. The view was of an old ugly building, and was supposed to be a harbor view. If you stood on the far right side of the window you could see the harbor. The bed was two twins stuck together, and the pool was about the size of a postage stamp.…",4
Not worth the money,20,Date of stay: June 2023,"Stayed twice, 1 night each at the beginning and end of a boating vacation out of the Naples harbor. High design hotel but pay attention or you won’t be able to work the shower. The windows in the 9th floor restaurant are beautiful but radiated so much heat I had to move. The restaurant is stupidly expensive and honestly the local trattoria was better. Then there’s the staff. The front desk is mediocre and the valets can’t even call a cab having to rely on the front desk staff. We had the front desk book a car tot the train stain for 4 people and 5 bags. The car that came was too small so, running out of time to catch our train, we asked for 2 normal sized cabs. The front desk manager was so irritated she came out and started berating us an insisted this was all our fault.…",4
Excellent,50,Date of stay: June 2023,"Excellent service, food and ambiance will def come back again! The restaurant tasting menu was superb and the pool im the roof is a nice addition to relax after walking around Naples. Reception team were attentive and professional.",4
An amazing stay!,50,Date of stay: June 2023,"The ROMEO completely exceeding our expectations. Such a beautiful hotel with amazing service. By far the best hotel we have ever been to! From the initial check in - Nicole helped us and was so sweet, helpful, and gave great recommendations. She definitely took our experience from a 9/10 to a solid 1000/10. Next time we are in Naples we are 100% staying at the ROMEO hotel.",1
The best choice in Naples,50,Date of stay: May 2023,The Romeo in Naples is one of the best hospitality experiences i have had in Europe till date... the staff was very warm and very well-appointed rooms.. Very courteous staff who were more than willing to make your trip as comfortable as possible.. had dinner in their specialty restaurant and it was just an excellent experience. though location is not absolute city center but still it was a good option for us.,13
Nice but pricey and I would consider elsewhere next time.,30,Date of stay: June 2023,"Easy to get to. Lovely staff. Comfortable bed. Good breakfast buffet. View from corner junior suite not the greatest - tatty warehouse directly opposite. Expensive valet parking. Expensive room service options. Decor eclectic. The room seemed not to make best use of space - just seemed smaller than stated size. Frustrating electrically operated curtains. The lobby area is nice with a nice bar and more eclectic decor. Nice cacti display around outside of the hotel. I did not eat in the restaurant, but it does have an expensive Michelin star restaurant. Overall, the price of the hotel is too much for what it has although we did enjoy our stay.",431
Loved this hotel,50,Date of stay: May 2023,"We started our three week trip in Italy and Malta at the Romeo hotel in Naples. The staff is friendly and super accomodating. I wanted a last minute street art tour and they found someone who was really good in an hour. The spa is really great with infra red saunas, a salt room and great steam and sauna area. You can easily spend the day there.They make a great martini at their fabulous bar. The design of the hotel is so interesting and everywhere you look you see something that you didn't see before. The rooms are great and I left my iPad and it was waiting for me when Ir returned to Naples three weeks later..i really wanted to stay there on my way back but they were full. I highly recommend this hotel when you re in Naples.",13
Rainy time in Naples,50,Date of stay: May 2023,Despite the rainy weather Hotel Romeo was a highlight and made out time in Naples exceptional. From the caring and helpful staff to simply the best hotel umbrellas I've experienced! The hotel spa is brilliant and easily worth spending an hour using the facility. Great views from our room to the harbour and great restaurant recommendations.,31
"Great sleep, nice room, service quality varied and expensive!",30,Date of stay: May 2023,"Service varied by way of quality. At breakfast we were not told there were hot options available on request. We only found out when we saw another guest getting fried/poached eggs etc. by then it was too late. On contrast the staff on reception were exceptional. Spa is great. Rooms clean, bright and so comfy. If service was consistently high I would have scored more. This is a 5 star hotel and IMO plenty of room for improvement in that department.",4
A wonderful stay in a marvelous city …!!,50,Date of stay: May 2023,"We were genuinely surprised how friendly the people of Naples are and how fascinating the city is. Our home (and really it felt like home) was ROMEO Napoli, and the hotel staff were our new family. The hotel is stylish, but comfortable … incredibly stylish, but also comfortable and welcoming.",1
Stay Review,50,Date of stay: May 2023,"Hotel was very well appointed. Stay was very kind and attentive. Upon our departure at 6:30am staff put together a to go breakfast for us to take to the airport, this was the cherry on top for us. Very we'll done!",3
Stylish and Comfortable,50,Date of stay: April 2023,"The staff at Romeo are top notch and helped us to relax and enjoy our stay while in Naples. The decor at Romeo is stylish, but not over the top. Our suite was a good size, clean and very comfortable. The coffee was excellent and the breakfast items high quality. My wife tells me the salt room at the spa was very nice. We have traveled a lot all over the world and we can definitely say Romeo is a fantastic hotel.",1
April trip,50,Date of stay: April 2023,"Beautiful hotel, lovely design, fixtures and fittings and top quality service. Outstanding breakfast and spa experience was great! Food in downstairs bar was also very good. Overall a great experience.",2
A fantastic hotel in Naples,50,Date of stay: March 2023,"Really a fantastic hotel. What really made it was the staff. Not only was everyone incredibly helpful and willing to do anything to make our stay better, they always remembered who we were and what we'd needed before. Nothing every got dropped (rare even at a 5-star hotel).",20
Exceptional oasis in the Bay of Naples,50,Date of stay: March 2023,"Everything about our stay was exceptional. The room was immaculate, comfortable and welcoming. The hotel architecture was a beautiful departure from the conventional luxury hotel, but lacked none of the expected luxuries. The breakfast was truly exceptional, even by the high culinary standards of Naples and Campania. And the staff was amongst the warmest, welcoming and helpful that we have encountered anywhere. Truly outstanding!",4
True Luxurious Accommodation,50,Date of stay: December 2022,"We stayed at Romeo Hotel for 9 nights in December while we were in the Naples area to celebrate my birthday. The location was perfect, restaurant and bar were second to none, and the staff were amazingly accommodating and friendly to name a few - Carmen, Francesco, and Georgio made a lasting impression on us. Georgio also made some of the best cocktails we had and was able to recommend cool evening activities for us. Every day the Romeo staff went out of their way to say hello and to see if there was anything they could do to help us enjoy our time in Naples. They arranged several fun activities for us such as a day trip on a private tour to Amalfi Coast, activities in the area, shopping, and were able to get us into some of the best local restaurants that we previously could…",1
Great New Year experience,50,Date of stay: December 2022,Service and amenities are excellent. The interior design is somewhat dated and too eclectic - but that's personal taste. We understand that the hotel will be refurbished in January. Special thanks to the people at the reception and the hosts at breakfast - top notch service and friendliness.,4
Exceeded the standard,50,Date of stay: December 2022,"The manager makes this hotel, his leadership is some of the best I’ve ever seen, the staff are a reflection of him, and they all exceeded the standard. Our experience was so good we came back again on our month long trip to Italy.",1
"Nice hotel, not worth the price",30,Date of stay: June 2022,"This hotel itself was nice, but I was disappointed with some of the amenities. One of the main reasons we chose this hotel was for the outdoor pool and deck, but when we arrived, we were shocked to find out that these amenities were closed without any notification or discount offered. This was especially disappointing since we visited during the COVID-19 pandemic and were looking for a place to relax outdoors while still being able to take mask breaks. For the price we paid (over $600 per night), I expected better communication and at least the option to use all of the amenities that were advertised. One of the best parts of the hotel was the breakfast buffet. The selection was vast, with options ranging from bread, cheese, fruit, and yogurt to pizza and eggs cooked to order.…",151
"Nice hotel, good quality",50,Date of stay: December 2022,"A good surprise. Hotel has a Very good location, good service and quality. I Will be back for sure. Perfect option to stay with Friends, family or for a romantic weekend. Breakfast was so delicious, staff so professional and friendly. Cleanneless IS top. Good job! We Will recommend to my friends",25
Central location,50,Date of stay: September 2022,"The hotel works for most people looking to quickly pass through. Not in a luxury area, but good for Naples. Very busy area around hotel, and you have to cab to most restaurants. (The Hotel restaurant was being remodeled during our stay.)",62
A great hotel,50,Date of stay: October 2022,The hotel is beautiful. From the moment you walk in and see the lovely artistic waterfall to the ninth floor where meals are served in a gorgeous room. Our Most positive comment is to the niceness of the staff. Everyone we interacted with was wonderful..,5
Terrible!,10,Date of stay: August 2022,What you see on their website and what you get when you are there are two entirely different things. You can do better staying elsewhere in Naples for sure and for a lot less money than this place. Where to begin!…the lobby bar and restaurant you see on their website is closed only open for special events….wish I knew that when we booked our trip because we thought that lobby bar would have been a cool place to have a drink with another friend who was also visiting Italy when we were. Their Michelin Star restaurant was also closed and won’t open until November if you believe their website?…that left us with one restaurant on the top floor serves luke warm coffee every morning despite sending it back only to be brought more luke warm coffee in return (see other reviews…,1
First Class Experience.,50,Date of stay: September 2022,"A really amazing time we had with the fantastic staff and the beautiful surroundings of the Romeo hotel. Everything was completely perfect, the service is top class and the friendliness of all the staff is really genuine !! Grazie mille!!",1
"Pumped up, overpriced. Horrible location.",30,Date of stay: September 2022,"Sorry but not really ""my cup of tea"". Designer, boutique, up-market, posh, expensive, stuffy, a bit full of itself etc.... Not relly what I look for in a hotel. Beautiful entrance lobby. Roof terrace needs to be booked!",1012
WE LOVED IT,50,Date of stay: September 2022,"The Romeo is an hotel on the dock side of a very busy, bustling city. Our first experience was the beautiful entrance lobby, with art and exotic items aplenty. We were greeted by a very helpful young lady, who made us feel so welcomed. We have visited the Italian peninsula many time, but never Naples before. What a city. Everybody that we encountered in the hotel tried their utmost to make our stay the best experience. We never had a problem with communicating ( in English ) with every member of staff. The breakfast was superb…by the way, the best scrambled eggs we have ever tasted. Lunch and dinner service was professional, with a great selection of local foods. We slept like logs on the comfy beds, and were surprised how successful the sound proofing was. We were on the main…",3
Poor,10,Date of stay: August 2022,"Really surprised how poor this place is. The other reviews are perplexing. 35 degrees outside, the lobby isn’t much cooler. There is warm water on the side to drink with no ice. A euro 550 per night has a view of scaffolding (see pic). The room itself is a box bathroom within a box bedroom ie half the bedroom is cut in to with the bathroom! You have to walk through the toilet area to get to the shower (?!) and perspex panels offer no privacy whatsoever. Bizarre blue light is the do not disturb button which lights up the whole room all night to the extent we had to switch it off. Other light debacles include the auto light when walking in the bathroom during the night and thereby waking the other up. Many of the electric sockets didn’t work nor the illuminated vanity mirror…",146
Wonderful Hotel in Naples,50,Date of stay: August 2022,"We spent a great night here! We loved the room design (except for the odd lighting system), the comfortable bed, and the helpful front-desk staff. The breakfast was also quite good and the location of the hotel worked well for sightseeing. Naples gets a bad rap, which I don't think it deserves. I look forward to going back to Naples and the Romeo in the future!",4
Unforgettable experience,50,Date of stay: August 2022,"From Alessandro and the woman who was working with him at the front desk to Francesco who not only helped with bags but kindly helped orient us, it was an amazing experience. Thanks for the sfogliatella dessert suggestion! They didn’t treat us like tourists but like a guest in their house house with all sorts of suggestions to have the optimal experience in a place they take pride in and they were on point each time. The hotel was also very luxurious - and clean. We also had an amazing view of all the big sites. Everything seems so thought out, making it very chill. Oh and try the complimentary brekkie! Def coming again.",1
A Hotel Done Nicely....,40,Date of stay: August 2022,"My wife and I just spent a few nights at the Romeo. The hotel is directly across from the piers where the Capri/Sorrento/Amalfi ferries and cruise ships dock. Rooms facing the Bay offer sunlight and decent views. The hotel is spotless top to bottom. The breakfast (which was included for our stay) is fabulous. Rooms and beds etc are comfortable and well appointed. Staff is helpful and friendly. There is no bar at the Romeo per se; rather, in the evening the 9th floor restaurant transitions to a temporary bar area. I wasn't thrilled with this but it worked fine for a few nights. Location of hotel is good - the places you would want to visit, eg, the opera, museums, many fine restaurants, are all reasonably close. Very east to get a cab there (the front desk will call…",54
Very bad,10,Date of stay: August 2022,"This hotel have a major problem, the bed are too small , impossible to sleep .. I m 187 cm and 84 kg , then I m normal, but this size of the bed is may be for Italian people ? The reçeption people are not professional, some will excuse them as it s difficult to find good staff after Covid. I did pay full price and receive half the service . As I cannot sleep, I was at the reception at 5 in the morning , telling the manager that I will leave as bed very bad ..he thread me to pay a extra night as I was leaving before expected ..! Of course , I did not even yet explain that we had to call 3 times the reception and wait 4 hours for them to split the double bed in 2 beds as I was with my daughter , and even more bad is that they are no insonorisation in the room as toilet are only…",122
Best hotel in Naples,40,Date of stay: May 2022,"100% the best hotel in Naples. Really friendly employees and generally a nice place to be. The only small issue with the room is the shower/toilet area. The design of it is so strange. Apart from that, the decor is quirky, they have a cool tv room in the lobby",26
A wonderfully warm welcome,40,Date of stay: August 2022,"Laurence and I arrived in Naples for our first ever visit last week: our flight was delayed and I let the Romeo Hotel know, they emailed me straight back and we were greeted with a warm, expectant welcome on Thursday evening. This says a lot about the staff at the Romeo: they are all helpful, attentive, quick to respond (we had to get our mini-bar unlocked and our TV needed to be reset), and unlike other reviewers comments everyone we spoke to understood English. The hotel is an eclectic art gallery full of whimsical touches and the rooms are spacious, clean with really comfortable beds. The lighting system takes some getting used to be but we felt completely at home during our stay. The breakfast buffet is extensive and you can get a great omelette or eggs any way you want.…",246
"O Romeo, Romeo, in Naples the love is real",50,Date of stay: July 2022,"This Small Luxury Hotel brand completely lives up to its name!! From the moment you walk in, you feel super welcome in the luxurious surroundings. The staff are exceptional, the highest standard. We arrived early, the staff arranged drinks at the roof top – and went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and kept us informed. The suite we stayed in was incredible. The size, the quality of the finishes, design of the room, Bodega soaps in bathroom, unlimited minibar, Dyson hairdryer, electric blinds, auto night lights etc. etc. Our suite had 2 bathrooms, the ability to split room with two sliding doors that blacked out all light. Everything branded Romeo from coat hangers to napkins. The room & bathroom is extremely spacious, with plenty of storage. The…",111
Lovely service,50,Date of stay: July 2022,"We were only in town for less than 24 hours before heading on to Positano, but this was a wonderful experience. I don't think we could have encountered a nicer group of front desk staff, manager, and doormen. Everyone was so friendly and the crowning touch was the sweet handwritten note accompanied by a jar of biscotti welcoming us to the hotel. We will return when we come back for longer to Naples.",11
Not worth it,30,Date of stay: July 2022,Most staff speaks no or very poor English. The reception staff was Ok. Terrible TV with no streaming app. Very bad wifi. Boring breakfast. Stupid automatic light system with the effect that a shower longer than one minute is done in darkness and a midnight pee wakes up your partner Very small pool area with no sun reaching the sun beds after 11.30 am,21
Fabulous,50,Date of stay: June 2022,"It’s a wonderful hotel it was very welcoming, the breakfast buffet is the best one ever anywhere. You can walk to all the best bits of Naples and there is a fantastic beach club just a short drive away for sea swimming and sunbathing",2
Amazing service,50,Date of stay: June 2022,"We stayed at the Romeo Hotel in Naples in June 2022. The staff were so kind and attentive. The hotel manager, Francesco, was extremely helpful and friendly too. The rooms were beautiful and very comfortable and included all the amenities we needed. This hotel was an oasis of luxury that was conveniently located within walking distance of the bustling city center and the Spanish Quarter. I would highly recommend this hotel for anybody visiting Naples or the Amalfi coast.",14
Best luxury hotel in Naples,50,Date of stay: June 2022,"Top notch luxury hotel of international standards - sleek, contemporary, elegant. Superbly appointed rooms and large bathrooms. Bottega Veneta amenities. Heavenly comfortable beds - amazing mattress & linen. Excellent sound-proofing & AC. Great dining options - best breakfast ! From July they inform guest the rooftop is going to reopen - following extensive renovations. there will be a larger outdoor pool, lounge bar and a gourmet restaurant. The largest and best Spa among all luxury hotels in Naples !",46
"FANTASTIC hotel! Great staff, great stay",50,Date of stay: June 2022,"I would definitely return to this hotel. From the second we walked in we felt so welcome. The hotel itself it like being in wonderland. Its beautiful and the décor they have around the place is breathtaking. I wish we would have had more time in this ultra modern, friendly, classy place.",102
wonderful hotel,50,Date of stay: June 2022,"I saw the hotel as part of an article in the airplane magazine. my wife and i were we staying in Amalfi for the week and decided to try out the Romeo Hotel for our last night in Italy. Great choice. the rooms were modern, convent, well appointed. excellent choice, we would stay again.",27
Wonderful Hotel! Wonderful Staff!,50,Date of stay: June 2022,"Beautiful hotel in Naples! The staff made the hotel ever more fantastic! They provided wonderful hospitality, and went above an beyond. They made items for us that weren't on the menu for my husbands birthday. They also boxed breakfasts to go for an early morning flight. The rooms had the most comfortable beds. Turndown service provided us a box of chocolates. It was a great stay! We would stay here again!",6
Two stays flying in and out of Naples,50,Date of stay: May 2022,Stayed one night on way to Capri and one night on return in route to from airport. Hotel and staff were outstanding. Front desk staff were very helpful. Room as very modern. On our return we stayed in a corner room which was extremely nice.,15
Friendly staff,40,Date of stay: May 2022,"Rooms are European small, bathroom toilet configuration is tight and odd. Wall coverings were way too busy. Rooms are clean, staff were very helpful. The included breakfast buffet was huge, something for everyone. The quality was excellent. Bar service was great, comes with lots of munchies.",167
Safe Haven,50,Date of stay: April 2022,"I was incredibly lucky to stay at Romeo as the manager and concierges took great care of me. Sadly as I was walking from the hotel to the ferry, my cell phone and credit cards were stolen. Although this was such a stressful experience, I was greatly comforted by Francesco who let me use his phone and office to cancel cards, and rebook my flight. He also generously paid for my dinner, airport taxi, hotel room, and covid test (he literally walked me to the pharmacy) and then I wired him money when I got home. The kindness and generosity was really above and beyond!",52
Your escape at Napoli,50,Date of stay: May 2022,"Great hotel in Naples first class service and accommodation. The booking for this hotel was made by us at the last minute following unexpected events and it was so gratifying to discover an amazing and willing staff to assist with a pleasant and warm welcome. It is not for nothing that we kept an eye on this hotel in the first place and as mentioned, it really kept its promise. The room we booked in the Junior Suite with a view of the harbor was cozy and comfortable, smartly and efficiently equipped, and included updated and modern comforts. The hotel is close to the port and within easy walking distance of Naples' central and historic sites, and public transport.",102

All Hotel Amenities Closed Without Disclosure,10,Date of stay: April 2022,"This hotel charges a high rate but when we checked in we discovered that the pool and restaurant are closed due to renovations. This was not, too my knowledge, disclosed at the time of booking. This means both of the public area floors of the hotel are completely closed. I was not offered any compensation for the lack of amenities. I would strongly recommend avoiding this hotel until the situation is resolved.",7
THEABSOLUTE BEST HOTEL IN NAPLES! You could not make a better choice.,50,Date of stay: April 2022,"Before this trip, I spent a lot of time looking through reviews and finally decided on Romeo and I am so glad I did. My family and I stayed there this month and we left so overjoyed and impressed. What stood out the most is their level of service. Every single staff member from the door to the restaurant was professional, kind, helpful, friendly, and attentive. Some of the staff that stood out were Alessandro, Luka, Mario, Danilo, Daniella and Chiara but it really included so many more names than we can remember. The rooms were beautiful (especially the wellness room with the infrared sauna and steam room), the breakfast was delicious, the restaurant is gorgeous. There is really no downside and we can't wait to go back. If you're on the fence about which hotel to stay at in…",33

AMAZING HOTEL & SERVICE! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,50,Date of stay: April 2022,"The hotel is beautiful and a short distance from the airport. However, what really impressed us most was the service from the hotel staff. This team really is amazing and does such an incredible job! The team is extremely helpful, attentive, respectful and super friendly! Kudos to the entire team including but not limited to Alessandro, Luka, Mario, Danilo, Daniella and Chiara. You have all truly made our stay special and felt like VIP guests throughout our entire stay! ¡Grazie Mille!",1
Hotel with Class in Napoli,50,Date of stay: April 2022,"I’ve stayed at the Romeo many times, and it’s always a very special occasion every time I stay. It’s in a great central location, but also has a wonderful view of Mount Vesuvius. The amenities are also top tier, and that goes for the service as well. On my stay at this time it was my birthday and Francesco and Alessandro were able to get me a triple tier upgrade and in general, wonderful person to talk to for any of your needs around Naples! I got a room with a wonderful view of the volcano and also a cake upon arrival. Special shout out to them, but all of the people working here are amazing! Shout out also too Mario and Fillippo. I always make sure to take advantage of the spa when I’m here and as an avid traveler, I can say this is one of my favorites in the entire world for…",10
They Got You,50,Date of stay: April 2022,"We arrived at the ROMEO Hotel from the Four Seasons in Florence, so you can imagine our mood. As an added stress they only re-opened the day earlier. I was a bit … judgy. And being ever the traveler I was .. nervous. The level of attention, care and love was immediately felt. But let’s first start with the design because it’s the environment and vibes that we pick up on when we travel. ROMEO Hotel was designed by Kenzo Tange and apparently he had a lot of opportunity to have fun. There are so many little fun moments in the lobby to admire. See the photos! We arrived in the unstable climate of early April. Our room was not air conditioned and we like to sleep like Polar Bears, the blanket as a heavy hug. Our first night was stuffy and .. well.. hot. We didn’t sleep. We…",59
September 2021,30,Date of stay: September 2021,"The front office staff, Fillippo was rude and very unhelpful. Its an expensive hotel but the view room we paid for was on the floor that looks at the parking lot. I would not stay here again. Most of the hotel was closed....no pool or roof top bar was open.",109
The Romeo is the best hotel in Naples,50,Date of stay: December 2021,I love my stay at the Romeo Hotel in Naples. The spa is terrific and I love the rooftop pool! I spent a long time in the pool. The location is centrally located and the staff is wonderful. I love the cool artwork and decor!,3
Great Stay,50,Date of stay: December 2021,"The pool and spa were exceptional included features. The room was nice as was the location. The pool was heated with a fantastic view and beautiful location adjacent to the restaurant. The spa had warm, hot and cold dip pools and two saunas. We loved our stay!!",2
One massive flaw with this hotel,10,Date of stay: December 2021,"There is one massive flaw with this hotel. You cannot set the temperature in your room to the temperature you want. I have stayed here three times in October to December and the first two times, I thought it was my problem not being able to re-set the room thermostat. The first time, I could cope and managed to sleep. The second time the room was freezing and I had to sleep in day clothes to stay warm. The final time, the room was 25 degrees and I couldn’t breathe! I called down to reception to ask for a technician to come to the room to show me how to work the thermostat and was told that it was centrally set and could not be adjusted. In such a modern hotel, this is ludicrous. I am apparently not the only person to complain but management don’t seem to want to know. This is…",71
Came for the view; would return for the service,50,Date of stay: August 2021,"I booked the Romeo specifically for the view of the Bay of Naples and Vesuvius. Note this is only likely if you book a junior suite because as well as some number of rooms facing the city, there is a port building across the road which could also block the view. The restaurant is on the top floor though and it offers an unobstructed view whether you are at breakfast, or dinner. (I am reviewing that separately but it is also excellent.) The room was exactly as described, and all the facilities including wifi worked well. The location is 90% plus, 10% minus. The plus is that it is very close to many of the sights: Castel Nuovo, Royal Palace, Via Chiaia. The ferries to Capri and the islands are literally across the road. The minus is that said road is busy, and the port itself is…",41
"Expensive, and border line worth it",50,Date of stay: August 2021,"The view is amazing. The service is good, but I was left flat to be honest. I expected more of this hotel when I booked it. When we arrived the valet was top notch. Unloaded our rental car and sent the bags straight away, brilliant! Check In was easy as well. When we got to the room it was gorgeous! Our daughter hogged the bath all night. We got a book that told us all about Naples. We ordered a bottle of wine and enjoyed it! Then we tried to book dinner. Fully booked. We walked to our own dinner. It was OK, but we got no recommendations from the hotel besides a small book. We returned from dinner and no knowing that guests were obviously not provided priority we tried to book the pool. The pool was the only thing our kids were looking forward to. I has shown them pictures…",250
Very stylish hotel not to be missed!,40,Date of stay: October 2021,"I just read Xmaxma’s review and totally disagree. Did we stay at the same hotel?? We just stayed there for 4 days at the end of Sept/early Oct and had an excellent time. The lobby area was stylish, very clean and well maintained. The lobby and bar areas are very well decorated and actually have comfortable seating throughout. In terms of decoration, I would have to say that it is one of the more interesting hotel lobby areas I have seen in many years. The outside cactus garden is quite large and also well maintained. The elevators run smoothly and we had close to zero wait time. The views from the upper restaurant and terrace are spectacular and the location makes taking a ferry to Ischia or Procida very easy. Lastly, the staff were excellent — very friendly and…",30
An ok hotel for €200,30,Date of stay: September 2021,Construction is going on all around the hotel. The lobby and rooms could be cleaner. Service is slow. I think the hotel is way overpriced. Be careful in south ipItaly everyone is trying to rip off some money off you all around.,1
Perfect home base in bustling Napoli,50,Date of stay: September 2021,"Napoli is a bustling city, with great potential for tourism, as it is also the center of an attractive region with Capri, Pompei, and the Amalfi coast all nearby. Hotel Romeo is a great starting point, and retreat after a day in the sometimes hectic and chaotic city. The architecture is modern, stylish, yet full of warmth. This stylishness combined with warmth and friendliness seems also common with the locals, and especially the staff of the hotel. They are competent and fast, but you also feel like their personal guest. The view on harbor shows a mix of industry, with some derelict warehouses, and giant cruise ships stopping for one day (which is definitely not enough for Napoli and is surroundings). Behind the harbor, you see parts of the bay of Naples, with Mount…",24
Romeo Disappoints,30,Date of stay: August 2021,"Situated on a fairly busy thoroughfare in Naples, this is a very sleek and stylish looking hotel. Our Jr Suite, facing toward the Bay of Naples, was adequate in size with modern bathroom. The view, however, was of assorted terminals from which ferries and cruise ships of all sizes come and go. There was no view of the Bay, Vesuvius or Capri. During our stay, the world's largest cruise ship arrived to the port and if we otherwise had had a view, this ship would surely have blocked it. The 10th floor open dining room does have a view...when there is the slightest breeze, the smell of marine fuel and the smoke stack stench are palpable. Reception helped us with dining reservations, but on several occasions provided us with misinformation, costing valuable time and missed…",34
Excellent Stay,50,Date of stay: September 2021,"Hotel Romeo was a delightful stay for my first visit to Napoli. Check-in was seamless, then housekeeping generously and quickly responded to my requests for a few items I neglected to pack. The pool is by reservation for Covid considerations, and though it is not for sport, was quite refreshing and beautiful to enjoy rooftop views of the city. In the lounge, Danilo’s command of English and warm demeanor put me at ease when I asked for expert local recommendations; and I appreciate the front desk’s partnership with a very prompt taxi for my early flight. In all, the gracious team at Hotel Romeo helped my solo business trip feel more like a lovely, relaxing weekend holiday. I look forward to my next visit!",4
Most comfortable and convenient stay in Naples,50,Date of stay: September 2021,"Romeo Hotel definitely has the best views as you can get rooms facing the port and Mount Versuvius which is very beautiful. The hotel has all of the modern amenities you need to be comfortable. I really loved the huge luxurious tub in my room. There's a spa, gym and great rooftop pool where you can swim and have drinks with a view. The hotel is close to the Spanish Quarter and within walking distance to the city center and all the main attractions of Naples without being in the thick of it all. Definitely recommend for a comfortable and convenient stay!",4
The Room Was Incredible!,50,Date of stay: August 2021,Really beautiful room with an excellent harbor view. Our evening dinners at the restaurant were so romantic. My expectations were met and exceeded in regards to the service provided by all the wonderful staff.,21
Very cool vibe with a wonderful restaurant and friendly staff.,40,Date of stay: August 2021,"We stayed 4 nights at Romeo after leaving a bad experience at the Villa Marina Capri Hotel. We were thrilled to get the extra night on one day's notice! Location is near the cruise ship docks so its a bit gritty, but we were able to walk to all the major sites in Naples. Our room, Deluxe harbor view, was small, but comfortable. The bathroom/shower configuration is tight, with one sink. The decor is an eclectic mix of Japanese zen and Italian. We loved it! Due to COVID, the bistro (more casual restaurant) was only open on weekends so we did not get a chance to try it; Il Commandante is a treat for gourmandes but not suited for casual dining at dinner. Breakfast and lunch are available and we enjoyed light lunch of pasta pomodoro and salad. The spa was closed, but the small pool…",10
Romeo hotel Naples,40,Date of stay: August 2021,"Dear all, we spent a nice week in Romeo hotel. All employed people were very friendly and customer oriented.

Great service,50,Date of stay: August 2021,"We were lucky to meet Alessandro, the best receptionist we ever had! He was kind, professional, funny,... everything anyone in this sector should aim for!

Best place to stay in Naples!,50,Date of stay: July 2021,"Stunning hotel with impeccable service. The restaurant is a “must do” with it’s superior food and staff plus amazing view of the bay. The location is a perfect mix — safe and luxurious with view of the water while you are in walking distance to the historic sites, local restaurants and shops.",2
"Not worth the money, really disappointing",20,Date of stay: June 2021,"Be aware that as of July 21, the pool is not in operation. This was not disclosed to use before we arrived. Even if it was open, you need to have a reservation and can only stay a maximum of 2 hours. Same with the spa. Even if you are a guest of the hotel, and just want to use the facilities (with no treatment appointment), you still have to make a reservation and only stay two hours. We booked this hotel in order to use their pool, and were very disappointed when we discovered it was closed. We called and went down to the front desk to see what other options we had. The staff was not very accommodating to make up for this. The spa was full, but they managed to squeeze us in. In other news, the porter took TWO HOURS to bring our luggage to our room!!! I wish I was joking. We…",2

They copied my credit card,10,Date of stay: October 2020,"On our last night at 2:50am I got a notification from my bank saying a payment had been declined, the hotel had copied my card and tried to take out £645, luckily I didn’t have enough money in my account for them to take it. Did speak to reception about it and they were very panicked and said it was a system error of theirs and does sometimes happen which doesn’t seem right to me. Never been to a hotel where that’s happened before and we paid our deposit at the beginning of our stay so wasn’t anything to do with that. Hotel was alright, not in an amazing area or views but we knew that from seeing pictures on here and Instagram. Spa was nice and room modern.",1
Great service and very modern,50,Date of stay: September 2020,"I had a great experience in this hotel with my friends for four days. Sadly due to covid there were very few other guests and the pool was restricted. Even with those restrictions the hotel was still amazing, they gave us great and friendly service. They had some amazing wines and restaurants. The interior is full of art and modern touches, a very nice games room to play some pool and listen to music and have some drinks. Their staff speaks very good english. I would really recommend this hotel to anyone staying in naples.",5
Not the view in the pic,20,Date of stay: September 2020,"Good points first. Staff were lovely, friendly and very helpful. Rooms were well equipped and clean. Now for the reality. We were in a Deluxe Harbour View room with in their words “a panoramic view of the Port of Naples and the harbour of Naples” and a “splendid view of land and sea”. They should write fairly tales because this is far from the truth (as my photos will show). From our room we had a splendid view of a large car park and a very drab, decrepit brown building. We could see a scrap of harbour between the ferries and Mt Vesuvius peeking over the top of the ugly brown building (if we stood at the window), from the bed it’s basically ugly building, as can be seen in my pics. We believe that the rooms are drastically overpriced and the website deceiving/misleading. The…",20
Excellent Hotel,40,Date of stay: August 2020,"Gret stay in Naples. Hotel received you in full security regarding Covid. All part of the hotel are well desing, and the small pool on the top a great place to enjoy the view on Vesuvio. The room are large, and very confortable",254
Excellent customer service,50,Date of stay: August 2020,"We have just checked out from a lovely stay at Romeo hotel. We booked this last minute & were so pleased with the service. Room was spotless & the housekeeper was excellent, she even ironed some clothes for us. The gym is just incredible with Technogym equip throughout, very high spec & we got great use out if it during our stay. Spa also is one of the nicest I've ever experienced and was a welcome recovery after the gym. Although the Michelin star restaurant was closed, the food in the bar/restaurant was excellent & the service just top notch. Very friendly & attentive staff & were so accommodating. Most importantly tye C-19 procedures were top notch & social distancing guidelines adhered to throughout. Perfect location for ferry day trips to Sorrento & Capri or a short stroll…",26
A nice modern boutique hotel in central Naples,40,Date of stay: July 2020,"Spent two days at Romeo prior to a yacht cruise, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Romeo is a modern boutique SLH hotel just by the harbour that in July 2020 was opening up after C19 lockdown. Mandatory C19 testing required in the hotel’s own testing bus prior to Check-in, but I guess that is something you have to accept in these times. Great service overall and a nice top floor pool by the bar. Only downside - one of the very few ultra modern buildings in central Naples where the architecture is otherwise dominated by buildings 100-300 yrs old.",18
Enjoyable time,50,Date of stay: July 2020,"Good location, valet parking. Right in front of the ship terminal. Nice views from the restaurant on the top floor during breakfast , or an evening drink. Lots of artifacts in common areas, which created nice atmosphere. Rooms are nice, well equipped, service is great, food is very good. Short walk to Piazza di Plebiscito and Lungomare. Not too far to the historical center too. Quite pricey.",2894
"Excellent, highly recommended",40,Date of stay: February 2020,"Gorgeous hotel frontage and reception. We had a lovely stay, using the upto date spa (sauna, steam, relaxation room etc) for upto 2hrs per day (quite expensive for treatments £130 and nothing extra special). We ate in the 9th floor restaurant for breakfast, gorgeous views, great selection and so tasty. 10th floor restaurant for dinner was an excellent experience, amazing views with friendly staff and gorgeous tasty food (highly recommended 65 degrees egg, wow)",1
Napoli in February,50,Date of stay: February 2020,"Fantastic service. Exceptional hotel. Will return.

Romeo hotel is a magical experience,50,Date of stay: February 2020,"I loved being in the magic of this hotel. The art pieces dotted here and there are fascinating, and every-time you walk past one or other you want to look again. The staff are extremely warm and welcoming, always helpful, so there’s nothing that you lack. The manageress, Gaia, is utterly charming and intelligent, and knows how to make you feel extremely relaxed. Home from home. The rooms are unbelievably comfortable and well thought out. Naples is an extraordinary, vibrant, contradictory and life-enhancing city, but first you have to pull yourself away from this most fabulous hotel. I haven’t even started on the wonderful food yet. The lights, the glass, vases made of lava, the ubiquitous cacti, and the sheer comfort of the public places. It’s a dream hotel, rate in its…",130

Our new favorite boutique hotel!,50,Date of stay: December 2019,"Romeo is a dream. Great design throughout, wonderful common spaces, great restaurants, the most awesome spa, and a superb location.

Wonderful visit,50,Date of stay: November 2019,"We have visited Naples many times on cruise ships, but this was our first hotel stay. The hotel is in an excellent location. Our room was spacious and we had a fantastic view of the port and Mount Vesuvius. Breakfast was delicious in an elegant venue. Staff members were all very friendly and helpful. We will definitely stay here again.",62
THE ART!!! Great Views Great Location,50,Date of stay: November 2019,"You must ask for an art tour when you stay at the Romeo. The history alone is reason to stay there, but truly a great location in town and of course access to the port, it is right there. Ask for a high floor. But when you are not enjoying the view, relax throughout the hotel and enjoy the art, all with a story.",4
Wonderfull view,40,Date of stay: October 2019,"So, this Hotel 's in a great location particuliery convenient for the port or city center. I found Rooms were very nice and luxurious.

Boutique oasis of luxury,40,Date of stay: October 2019,"Recently spent 3 nights in a 2 bedroom suite using as a base for a Vesuvius. Pompeii, and Amalfi trip. Its truly welcoming and exceptional for that. It's adult/business orientated in the main, but nevertheless excellent service and friendly staff. Modern, clean, dramatic and brilliantly comfortable spacious rooms. Just watch the overall location; it's a little outside the main tourist strip, away a bit from the the end of the nicer marina area, closer to the cruise liners right on the docks. You are unlikely to be taking an evening stroll into the city from here. That said, safely ensconced each night tucking into truly exceptional food in both the 9th floor restaurant (great views) or delicious room service you can't really beat it.",222
modern surroundings in an ancient city,50,Date of stay: October 2019,we stayed two nights at the hotel beautiful location near the marina. the top floor restaurant was excellent and the service great. I will definitely visit again loved the modern furniture even though I am conservative,77

Excellent Naples Experience,50,Date of stay: October 2019,"We really enjoyed staying at the Romeo Hotel, had a great room overlooking the working port at cruise ship end and Mt Vesuvius and Capri. Room was quiet and very comfortable, great shower. The staff are mostly amazing and the breakfast is excellent. On our last day I was a bit disappointed with the room servicing, it seemed like because we were checking out the next day that it was done half heartedly. However when I spoke to the concierge he was very helpful in addressing this. It certainly did not spoil our stay and I would definitely book there again.",18
Stylish hotel,50,Date of stay: August 2019,"We stayed in Hotel Romeo for 4 days before we headed to Positano. As a family of four, the hotel has a few types of room can cater our needs. We stayed in a Suite with castle view which is very spacious and tastefully decorated. The beds are comfortable and I like the amenities from BV. The hotel is located on a main road, close to the cruise pier and just a short walk to some of the landmarks in Naples, and that made me feel safer and easier to find my way back even after sunset. We had dinner at Il Comandante, a Michelin star awarded restaurant and could not be more pleased with their food and services. It's not to be missed if you're in Naples. We also had an enjoyable dinner in the other restaurant of the hotel which also serve breakfast. Both restaurants have a…",12
Perfectly located for a stopover,40,Date of stay: October 2019,"Stayed 1 night at the beginning of our trip to Capri. Modern upscale design hotel with a lot of Japanese touches. Very friendly and helpful staff. Despite the traffic in front of the hotel, very, very quiet. Rather a business hotel than a boutique hotel for an extended stay. It is perfectly located as a stopover for taking the ferries to the islands like Capri; just a 5 minutes walk. As such, looking at and over Naples industrious port and cruise ships, but 15 minutes walk away from the waterfront to Palazzo Reale and the Piazza del Plebiscito or the outskirts of the Spanish Quarter. Metro closely to explore other parts of the City.",221
Meh.,20,Date of stay: October 2019,"Not a 5 start hotel for sure. The view from our junior suit was obstructed with some trucks and port stuff ( Never be fooled with their website's pictures) . The mattress was not comfortable at all ,and way below the average breakfast although the view there is nice. Definitely do not worth the 500++ Euro we payed :( I suggest that you ask for a picture of the room your looking for to be sent from the hotel before you get surprised.",55
Below level snack food,20,Date of stay: October 2019,The view from the restaurant was nice but the snack food was not. One would think that a tomato buffala would be excellent in Naples...well not here. Tomatoes were tasteless and the bufala mozarella like rubber. Maybe they should check their suppliers chain...I believe that in such a hotel a simple salad should be excellent.,19
"Nothing Special, but Perfect for Stopovers in Naples",40,Date of stay: October 2019,"Overall: Stayed 1 night, used it as a connection between our stay on Capri and a flight out of Rome the next day. Super modern, lots of dark colors. Takeaways: 1. Location is perfect for getting to Ferry's/boats (2 min walk) and 5 min taxi to train station. 2. I would put this into more of a business style hotel, I wouldn't want to stay there long primarily because its Naples (sub-par city) and also because of the design/feel is uber modern and not my taste. 3. Don't take my tastes and assume its a bad hotel, its very clean, nice staff and is an upscale hotel, I just wouldn't view it as a place to stay for a ""vacation""",35
BEST HOTEL,50,Date of stay: October 2019,This hotel was beautiful! Was extremely clean and the staff was very nice! Best hotel so far in Europe that I have stayed in. This hotel is right across from the port so its easy access to travel to other cities. Right by coffee shops and many restaurants. Takes a few minutes to walk into the actually city/ shopping district. Would def stay here again!!,2
A superb 5* hotel near Napoli harbor.,50,Date of stay: October 2019,For our last night in our Campania Area vacation we picked Romeo hotel. It’s a 5* High tech hotel. The room is not big but with very modern design very well equipped. Breakfast and the small pool on the roof were good and pleasant. The hotel is warmly recommended.,61
Beautiful hotel by the docks.,50,Date of stay: October 2019,"This is a beautiful hotel with extremely comfortable beds, modern technology, delicious food and most important excellent customer service. The wait staff in the restaurant were wonderful! Even though both our rooms looked out over the docks and a busy street, we did not hear any noise. Location was perfect for us as we did a day trip to Capri and the marina for the Hydrofoils were across the street. The hotel is close to shopping and sightseeing. Just perfect!!",13
So comfortable with amazing service,50,Date of stay: October 2019,We have stayed at 3 different locations in Rome. This amazing gem is by far the best you will find. The bed is so comfortable.

Great!,50,Date of stay: October 2019,"Very enjoyable stay. Good location close to ferries, old town and Borgo area, very well equipped room, elegant design, friendly staff. Did not try restaurant or breakfast facilities, so can't comment on that.",85
Such an incredible experience,50,Date of stay: October 2019,"Super modern hotel in a very interesting point of Naples few steps from downtown and just in front of the harbour where you can take ferry to Capri. I didn't miss a walk in the city, really vibrant and colourful. The hotel Is Just perfect,from the doormen welcome to front desk, rooms spacious and confortable. I tried just the 9th floor restaurant and the breakfast service is smooth and impeccable full of neapolitan delicacies; i would like to mention waiter Francesco for the service, kind and professional. See you and thanks!",1
Not quite a 5 star view,40,Date of stay: October 2019,"We booked the harbor deluxe view room and while the room was stunning, the view not so much. We were basically looking at a ship yard. The bed was too firm for my taste. The breakfast is great and served on the 9th floor which has a really nice view, but it is hard to enjoy because the sun is too bright. The need solar shades on the windows. Service was outstanding.",219
Fabulous Experience!,50,Date of stay: September 2019,"My husband and I enjoyed two nights at the Romeo Hotel and were very pleased with our room, our view, our restaurant experience and with the service of every staff person with whom we interacted. We'll definitely be back.",17
Almost,40,Date of stay: October 2019,"We got off to a bad start as someone made an error and had the wrong time for our arrival on the ferry, so we were not met. We had two very large suitcases so even though the hotel was close we needed to take a taxi. The manager apologized, credited us for the taxi ride and sent a bottle of Prosecco and a lovely chocolate cake with pistachios. As we had just left a hotel with a very difficult bath to get into I was delighted by the modern stall shower. Everything was clean and newish and worked well. The decor has to be to one’s liking - it is quite modern. The room itself (and we had been given an upgrade) was small and the one chair was so low that it was tough to get out of. The breakfast buffet was nice, but the location of the room was a major miscalculation. It is…",153

Sublime Hotel!,50,Date of stay: October 2019,"Excellent in every way, every detail has been thought of from the art pieces to the rooms comfort levels, the service superb and as is the breakfast, pool, spa and staff! Great location if departing by ferry to the islands too.",105
Beautiful lunch spot,50,Date of stay: October 2019,We popped in here for lunch while waiting for the ferry. The view was stunning and the service flawless. Staff created something for my vegetarian diet which was delicious. Also they helped print off our ferry tickets. I had a massage and used the spa. The spa was immaculate and lots of different water and heat experiences with animated TV screens showing relaxing views. Great staff and great facilities.,38
Modern Hotel in perfect location,40,Date of stay: September 2019,"The Romeo Hotel is situated close to the old city and the ferry harbour of Naples. It is the perfect location to be staying when you are in Naples. It's only a 10 minute walk from the hotel to the ferry terminals where you can get a boat bringing you to Capri, Procida or the Amalfi coast. It's also close to the old city where you find the best Pizza places and other great restaurants. However, especially US travellers must get used to the fact, that the hotel rooms are rather small. The roof terrace offers a spectacular view over the harbour and the Vesuvio. The staff at the hotel is very friendly, helpfil and very professional. Everyone from the receptionists, the bell captain, waiters and the chamber mates are just great!",17
Our second stay,50,Date of stay: September 2019,"This was our second stay in this fabulous hotel in the hearth of Naples port. This time we have opted for the suite with zen garden and private jacuzzi which is great choice if you want to spend some time also in private. The rooftop pool overlooking port with view of Vesuvio is the main selling point and it is just a place to be, we have spent really lot of time there so i would like to thanks to all the staff for the great service we have recieved there, especially to Nicola! Also I recommend to visit the ""Comandante"" michelin star restaurant on the TOP with great manager. Grazie a tutti e ci vediamo a prossima volta!",195
Family Reunion,50,Date of stay: October 2019,"Superb Hotel ! Nothing too much trouble for the staff who spoke English better than my Italian! They were fantastic with our 10 month old grandson who enjoyed the breakfast and the attention he received. The restaurant on the 10th floor was exceptional - the food was unbelievable, each course brought something different, it was truly outstanding. The wait staff were amazing and introduced each course succinctly and were very friendly and attentive to all our needs. Rooms were cleaned to a high standard and we looked forward to the little treats that were left behind. Would definitely recommend this Hotel and would love to come here again.",2
3 day stay in Naples,50,Date of stay: September 2019,"Great hotel, very knowledge staff (ask them for places to eat and drink), excellent facilities. We very much enjoyed spending time out on the pool / hot tub deck. Views for breakfast of Mt Vesuvius are exquisite and gives you a great feeling for the port. Highly recommend.",1
No 5-star treatment,20,Date of stay: September 2019,"Stayed at the hotel for the last night of our honeymoon. Thought I would splurge with a wellness suite, massage and reservations at the restaurant to make it special and was incredibly excited for our first five-star experience. Unfortunately, after using the shower, the entire bathroom flooded. I was panicking on my hands and knees with towels, robes, anything I could find to help soak up the mess while my husband ran down to reception for help. Cleaning staff was sent and chalked it up to being a drain that hadn't been cleaned properly ahead of our stay, but beyond that, the problem wasn't addressed. No apology for the issue - nothing. Maybe it is my own misconception of what five-star service is, but if I am paying over $700 to spend about 15 hours at a hotel and a…",2
Perfect hotel for area,50,Date of stay: September 2019,All the amenities of home plus some. Beds/linens were soft and so comfy. Service was fast and friendly. Only complaint was there is a learning curve of controlling lights and using shower. You can just take some time to play with these or ask for help. Breakfast was super yummy and service was great.,19
Excellent staff,40,Date of stay: September 2019,The hotel is older but the inside is refreshed to a very good scale. It’s central to good shopping and walking. The staff was welcoming and very helpful. The room was clean and well stocked. I recommend it,12
Fantastic hotel,50,Date of stay: September 2019,"This is an amazing hotel.We stayed with friends for 5 nights. Staff are helpful and very friendly. The hotel is very clean .

Naples,40,Date of stay: September 2019,The hotel is very centrally placed for the Harbour and all the shuttle boats to the islands and Amalfi Coast It is very modern with an art form atmosphere and excellent rooms The Beluga Bistro on 9th floor serves excellent food food with a good view of Naples Bay and Vesuvius but at a price! The staff there including Ciro and Francesco are very attentive and helpful The hotel is good - though it would have a more lively atmosphere if the ground floor lobby bar and facilities were open and staffed regularly.,20
Five star modern hotel in front of the port,50,Date of stay: September 2019,We spent 2 evenings in Naples after a wonderful week on Capri. The hotel was very modern and exceeded my high expectations. Simone went above and beyond to make sure we have a 5+ star experience. The spa was a nice bonus as well as the pool. Unfortunately we were not able to enjoy the pool due to close proximity of smokers. The buffet breakfast was lovely with excellent service. I would recommend this property without any hesitation and look forward to returning again in the future.,10
Great for traveling in/out of Naples!,40,Date of stay: September 2019,"We stayed at Romeo Hotel for the last night of our honeymoon before flying out of Naples to go back home the next day. Overall, upon arrival, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Included in our room rate was access to the SPA for both of us which was extremely relaxing. We actually had all of the facilities to ourselves which were very nice. We also added on a couples massage which I wouldn't recommend. Definitely use the SPA area, but the couples massage was mediocre at best considering the $260 euros they charged. The pool on the rooftop was also beautiful, but the surrounding area was less than ideal. The view of the rooftop is actually mostly of giant cruise ships and a parking lot. Overall, if you are looking for somewhere to stay that is conveniently located…",1
allergic,50,Date of stay: September 2019,"We loved the hotel but I suffered from severe allergies (dust and dust mites). This isn't about cleanliness (the room was clean) it is about allergy covers on duvet, pillows, fsoft furnishings, cushions etc.",1
Wedding Anniversary,50,Date of stay: September 2019,We had a great experience. awesome service. beautiful property. fantastics spa. Great location. We checked to see if they had more hotels in other cities. Too bad they don't. We'll just have to go back to Naples.,1
Great Downtown Napoli Hotel,50,Date of stay: September 2019,"We loved the location even though construction was nearby. The view of Vesuvius was terrific and so close to shopping, restaurants, waterfront walks, etc. The modern design, the room, restaurant and service was exceptional. One of the best hotels we've stayed in.",6
my stay,50,Date of stay: September 2019,"The service was excellent, and the hotel was very clean. We didn't have time to eat at the restaurant, but the food looked amazing! If I am ever back in Napoli, I would prefer to stay at the Romeo hotel.",1
Amazing Hotel,50,Date of stay: June 2019,This hotel was amazing! From its room to its breakfast its pool although small but was very practical with its heated water and jacuzzi and the view was breath taking. The coffee house was excellent with its choice of food and the service was Impeccable. This was the only thing we found enjoyable in Naples and not forgetting the location just a stone throw to the ferry terminal. what more can you ask for . However the Michelin rated restaurant was a disappointment I think the food at the coffee house was much better.,7
Special thanks,50,Date of stay: August 2019,"Our stay was really special and very pleasant . My wife and myself would like to take this opportunity to thank our very special staff, at the beluga restaurant, that took a really great care of us and was very professional “Giovanni” . It is just a great job Giovanni , please keep it on and wish u all the best. Regards",4
"Friendly staff, nice room, poor food",20,Date of stay: August 2019,"Nice greeting on arrival. Room is comfortable. But quite shocked to order a ham and cheese sandwich for €23 - in a 5 star hotel, and this is all it is. (Attached) Bite is mine, one of the most bland sandwiches I’ve ever had. No different from a €2 sandwich from a service station. Earlier today my wife had a salad & felt very ill all day afterwards. My club sandwich was also poor. Cannot recommend highly, sadly.",4

Mediocre experience overall,20,Date of stay: August 2019,"Booked one night before heading back home, after 10 wonderful days spent on the Amalfi coast. Reserved a Deluxe Harbour View on the Hotel's website. Lack of attention and generosity during our stay: no availability at the Spa upon arrival (for any treatment actually), no alternative options were given for the next day. Not a 5 star experience. Other small details created some frustration, and made us feel uncared for, neglected. We did have a great dinner at the Bistrot, thank you to the team on the 9th floor. Will not come back nor recommend the Romeo.",20
Romantic stay in Romeo Hotel,50,Date of stay: August 2019,"This was a very lovely stay in a hotel with only friendly people…valet parking perfect, gastronomic dinner in Il Comandante ! We will be back soon, to enjoy again all the experiences we had during our short stay",222
Aug 1-4 Stay,30,Date of stay: August 2019,"Decent hotel, however the bed mattress was very poor. We could feel the springs and the boxspring through the mattress. For the price charged and star rating, would have expected better. Hallways were also very noisy.",2
Upscale style in great location,40,Date of stay: April 2019,"The newest and probably the fanciest hotel in Naples. Very upscale, modern hotel on a main street with beautify views of the harbor, bay, and Mt. Vesuvius. Our room was very large with a view of the bay and the cruise ships coming and going. The bathroom was especially fancy with an all-glass shower with a “rain” showerhead and a vanity in a separate area. The TV had several English channels. It is about a 10 minute walk to the Piazza de Plebicito, the Royal Palace, the Teatro San Carlo, and the Castle Nuevo. In fact, just about everything else in Naples is with walking distance as well. Breakfast buffet was included with our stay. Food was plentiful and tasty, with many different types of food (both European and American). The Italians don’t quite understand…",27
stylish luxury,50,Date of stay: July 2019,"My wife and I stayed 4 nights in July 19. All staff were friendly, professional and attentive. Room was comfortable and reasonably spacious. Cleaned to high standard. Great washroom facilities (plenty of space to actually put your wash stuff - too often overlooked). Breakfast was varied and all to high standard; v. good coffee, v. good poached eggs, and particularly liked the pastries (a local speciality). V. good restaurant service. Pool area on the roof was a bit space limited but not especially busy - hence served the purpose. But the main thing was the view from the restaurant and roof top pool area: Over the port area and city outskirts then Vesuvius in the distance to the left and scanning across the bay of Naples with Capri to the right. Spectacular (my photo's don't do…",50
"Lovely hotel, convenient location.",40,Date of stay: July 2019,We stayed for 2 nights at the Romeo Hotel and really enjoyed our stay. All the staff were very welcoming - and were happy to make suggestions to where we should visit in the short time we had in Naples. The rooms were beautiful and clean with evening turn-down service. Sadly we did not have time to experience the wellness centre. The pool area is quite small with the only sun loungers available (that I could see) are around the pool and are in shade on the afternoon. Buffet breakfast had a wide range of foods available and was very relaxed. We ate in the hotel restaurant on the first evening and had a very pleasant meal (sadly the michelin star restaurant was not open the evening we were there). The breakfast area has a clear view of Vesuvius (as seen on the hotel website) with…,73

"Excellent, great experience.",50,Date of stay: July 2019,"Loved it. Great location, we walked to the city center for dinner and back. The service was excellent and the breakfast top quality. Great location, close to all the meet points for my tours. Excellent staff, no problem finding an English speaker",1
Excellent Stay,40,Date of stay: July 2019,"Overall, the stay was great. Nice clean hotel. Service at breakfast and for evening drinks could be more attentive. For example, they seated 3 of us for breakfast at a table with only two settings, but did not set a third person. We had to get a setting ourselves from another table.",61
Hotel wonderful. Location not.,50,Date of stay: July 2019,I can’t say enough positive about the hotel and the service. The rooms and the common spaces are beautiful. However the location is far from ideal. Neighborhood is shabby and it was uncomfortable to walk around the area. The next time we would most likely stay in the Santa Lucia area.,1
Romeo Hotel Naples - Excellent Hotel & Service,50,Date of stay: July 2019,I have to say the Romeo Hotel is truly a 5 star hotel with 5 star service. It had all the WoW factors associated with Hyatt associated hotels. Staff really played their part to make our stay perfect. The hotel is in great condition with stunning views and facilities.,9
The Best Hotel in Naples,50,Date of stay: July 2019,"I have stayed and many hotels in Naples and by far my favorite is Romeo Hotel, across from the port, a beautiful, well kept modern building, adorned with exotic cactus, world class contemporary art and a Michelin star restaurant: Il Comandante. The rooms are exceedingly comfortable and many feature stunning views of Vesuvius and the Bay of Naples.",30
Great hotel in Naples,50,Date of stay: July 2019,A fabulous hotel with a great view of the bay. The location was great to tour Naples. Staff was helpful and nice. The Deluxe Harbor Suite was perfect with more than enough space for the four of us. Would definitely stay here again if I came to Naples.,2
Fantastic 26h at Naples,50,Date of stay: July 2019,Unfortunately we could only stay one night. But we enjoyed our 26h stay at Naples to the maximum thanks to hotel Romeo and the staff. The location is in walking distance of most of the city highlights and the view from our room or from the rooftop swimming pool on the Vesuvius is great. The staff gave us fantastic tips on where to eat (their own Michelin starred restaurant was closed as it was a Monday evening). Our lunch at the hotel was the best pasta we had during our stay in Italy and the breakfast buffet is great. When I go back to Naples I definitely will go to Hotel Romeo.,104
Romeo is the beast,50,Date of stay: July 2019,"This hotel is great. It’s a fantastic location, great bar and pool, great restaurant. Service is excellent. The spa was a relaxing respite after a long day of travel. We will stay here again absolutely.",1
Modern Gem Steps from the Hyrdofoils to Capri and Ischia,50,Date of stay: July 2019,THE place to stay in Napoli. Fabulous location and easy to visit Amalfi Coast locations and Naples.

Stylish Modern Hotel overlooking the port,40,Date of stay: July 2019,"Boutique style hotel with lovely bar / restaurant views out over the Bay of Naples. Friendly, helpful staff and an outstanding restaurant experience. Rooms are a little on the small side with insufficient space for baggage. Stylish shower wet rooms have insufficient towel hanging space and annoying movement sensitive lighting which leaves shower room in darkness after a few minutes (I was still in shower!) Overall, the style of the establishment, the food quality and the friendly, professional staff made for a very enjoyable stay. As befits the nature and quality of the service it is expensive.",18
Style over substance,20,Date of stay: July 2019,Not up to usual mr and mrs Smith standard. Mediocre Rooms less than adequate. Understandably rooms not as website suggests and comments about hotel accurate. Service at front desk excellent on arrival and during our stay. 9th floor restaurant maitre d rude and although a lot of staff very poor service. Waited 20 mins to even be offered a drinks menu and when I asked to order I was told all waiters very busy on the floor. Room mediocre. Room service poor. Turn down service is clearly limited to literally turning down bed covers! Bathroom left untouched and unserviced even from the day with toothpaste marks still remaining and towels adrift. This is by no means a 5 star hotel. Far from it. Very very disappointing.,117
Modern hotel in tough city,40,Date of stay: July 2019,"Best hotel in the city. Not a city I would want to visit again and there are very few decent hotels here, so if want at least 4 star plus then this is a good option. Staff are generally very helpful. Ok restaurant and small outdoor pool area, which was very popular during our stay - albeit absolutely no service at the pool unless you go looking for it. Beautiful day spa in the basement of the hotel. Interesting lobby area with table games. Unfortunately we didn’t notice until the last day - the hotel amenities were not pointed out to us on arrival. Staff were very helpful in providing information to get around the city.",10

I presented them with proof (written Amex confirmation) that the reservation was in fact booked through Amex and they didn't care, said that all that mattered was their online system (which of course only they can see and control). After a lot of insistence, they finally agreed to include breakfast in the rate making it seem like a huge gesture on their part, but said the upgrade wasn't possible due to no availability (when in fact the hotel showed plenty of availability online to the next room category), another lie. When I confronted them and showed them the availability, they got…",1
Not a five star hotel,40,Date of stay: July 2019,"This is not a five star hotel, it is a four star hotel. This is because the room especially the bed is quite small, not possible to accommodate an adult and the spa snd rooftop pool are quite small. Overall, facilities do not suffice to accommodate a hotel of this size. There were less than ten chairs aroubd the pool and the pool can accommodate at most ten people but thete are at least 100 rooms so at least 200 guests in the hotel.

Modern Italian touch!,50,Date of stay: June 2019,"We have choiced Naples for a weekend stop before reaching Sicily. Having already been in that area last year, in Sorrento and Capri, wanted to visit better the city itself. Romeo hotel is not nicely located, close to harbour but not far from downtown. Walking in the surrondings of the hotel is not a good choice, but the hotel itself is perfect and in less than 15 minutes you are in the city centre. Hotel is modern with high tech design elements. It offers multiple bars, rooftop restaurant and pool, and a gym and spa (very expensive but extremely nice).

Last stop on our way up the coast before flying home,40,Date of stay: June 2019,The Romeo hotel is a very nice four-star business type hotel although was perfectly fine for our last day on our trip up the coast. Although we stayed two nights to take in some of Naples in the end weregretted not just doing one night before our flight out. Not that the hotel itself had any issues.

Location is in the port so great for cruising to Capri or taking a car to Pompeii. Rooms are very modern and well built. Clearly the owner or owning group of this hotel knows a high quality product line. Where this hotel goes downhill is it's staff which is actually disappointing as owners work so hard to build something just to have the face of the company (staff) compromise the quality. Staff was often rude, pompous and unresponsive. We emailed several times, once about the spa and the availability in which case we did not receive a response and again about the $7000 credit card holds during our stay there which they disputed even after I showed them the…",2
Great spot in Naples,40,Date of stay: May 2019,"We booked a corner suite which had a great view of the harbour and Bay of Naples with all the ships coming and going. The room was large, well appointed and very comfortable. The hotel is very modern with clean lines. Breakfast in the morning was in a lovely room with another great view of the harbour. Walking distance to the ferry terminal and the castle. Staff was very helpful and friendly. The bartender in the lobby bar was great, Nicola, was lovely very interesting to speak to - and made a great Negroni! The wine cellar is gorgeous!",132
Amazing stay in Napoli,50,Date of stay: June 2019,"From the second I arrived, I could tell the quality of the hotel. A friendly greeting and smooth check in. The kind lady on reception showed us to our room and how everything worked. The room itself was amazing and had all the small touches an excellent hotel should have; water and charging port right near the bed, the most comfortable pillows, robes & slippers, which I might add is not a luxury found in many Italian hotels, and all the other amenities you could imagine. This place is a haven in a busy city and definitely whilst travelling through Italy. It’s right beside the port and had a metro link a few minutes away. The pool was small but cute and had a view of mount Vesuvius. Wouldn’t think twice about staying here again, loved every second and didn’t want to leave!",23
Great place to stay in Naples,50,Date of stay: June 2019,Everything about this hotel is super impressive. They obviously put a lot of work into their decor because it's all very modern and cool. The restaurant has a great view and the pool was really nice. I wish the pool was bigger but given the space constraints it made sense. The staff was friendly and helpful. When we needed a cab it was there in less than two minutes! Naples is a wonderful city and the hotel is very centrally located. I would definitely stay here again.,1
Helpful staff who went out of their way,50,Date of stay: May 2019,"My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon, which was our first three nights being in Naples. We loved our Wellness Suite. It was absolutely beautiful, with a nice sitting area and fireplace. The furniture was clean and modern and there was ample closet space for our belongings. We also had a beautiful jet tub, along with the listed amenities (sauna, steam room and a private toilet room). The drinks, food and views were also to be commended. The decor had such amazing personality, as well. Please stay at the hotel that doesn’t let you down. The most important aspect of our stay, however, was the service.

Lovely Naples hotel.,50,Date of stay: June 2019,Very good all round experience. Concierge desk was excellent. The spa was very good. Restaurant facilities excellent.Disappointed that there was no mention of the extremely ugly warehouse blocking our view of the harbour!,4
This hotel was excellent!!!!,50,Date of stay: June 2019,I was beyond happy with this hotel!!! So beautiful!!! It was extremely relaxing and gorgeous!!! So close to the port! Literally walked across the street and got on the ferry to the beautiful Capri!!!! Truly a beautiful hotel and staff!!!!,2
"Nice staff, nice restaurant, bad everything else",20,Date of stay: June 2019,"Very nice staff, and quite a good Michelin starred restaurant with a wonderful wait staff. But that's about it. The decor of the hotel is kinda cool, if it was still 1989. However, the rooms are HORRIBLY designed...from the non-functioning AC (and forget trying to read the ridiculous directions); the weird motion sensor lights in the bathroom that go off while you're showering; the inexplicably complicated light switches; the shallow sink that causes water to splash out everywhere; to the fact that the shower door opens flush to the floor, which means you can't put a bath mat down because the door just sweeps it away. AND YET, even then this place would be passable, but for the FILTHY shower stalls that had MOLD and SOAP SCUM. Housekeeping is clearly not well-managed! IMO,…",5
Was treated with disrespect,10,Date of stay: May 2019,"I was travelling as a single woman and I felt like I was treated with disrespect at this hotel.

Naples for a 50th Birthday,50,Date of stay: May 2019,"A short trip for my wife's 50th, heading out to Pompeii and the Amalfi Coast using Naples as a base, we decided upon the Hotel Romeo as being near to everything within Naples that we wanted to see and our experience of the Hotel, its staff and the amazing Il Comandante restaurant were nothing short of exceptional, the restaurant was worth the visit alone. The room we had was a deluxe double with a decent sea view, not that we were in the hotel too much as there was too much to do elsewhere, the room was very clean and tidy with everything we needed. We had great service from all the staff we met who were friendly, kind and courteous which made our short stay even better and we had a memorable stay for my wife to look back on for this special birthday.",1
Definitely the best hotel in Naples,50,Date of stay: May 2019,My family stayed here for an evening after the Amalfi Coast. It was a beautiful hotel with great decor and a kind staff. It was conveniently located to Old Town and had a lot of walkable attractions. We had a two bedroom suite and it was stunning. I would definitely stay here again. Only comment is that they made the photos of the pool look much larger than it is. It is a really small space so don’t expect to make a day out of that.,226
"Beautiful, classy and unique hotel",50,Date of stay: May 2019,"Wow, what a refreshingly unique hotel. I was with group and we were warmly welcomed into the beautiful lobby with some refreshments and pastries. Then I got to the room and found a lovely hand written note with some decadent chocolate. Each day they even had a different treat waiting for me. They even had turn down service and they placed slippers by the bed. The room was very modern, but classy too. The bed was very comfortable and I slept well. The one very small complaint was I struggled a bit with the lights and other switches. For instance the drapes were on a motorized system and the controls were by the bed. But if that's my only complaint, then they're doing well. The breakfast was very nice and filling with a beautiful presentation. The location was good as you…",36
Odd location but the spa is worth the stay,40,Date of stay: May 2019,"I booked this hotel based on the fact it has been nominated as a Mr & Mrs Smith Hotel, a brand I trust and rarely lets me down. I can see why this has been nominated as such - in a chaotic city like Naples, there aren’t many boutique options and I’m sure this is probably one of the best of the bunch. However at more than £350 a night it is certainly punchy considering other options which are more central. If you want to stay one night in Naples and consider being close to the port (Molo Beverello) an advantage, then it’s a good option. The spa is really excellent.

Brilliant luxury in chaotic Naples,50,Date of stay: May 2019,"A stunning hotel, sleek and modern. Very comfortable beds and great service. We liked the location based on proximity to metro, one stop from train station, and about a 20 minute taxi to airport. It was in a good area for walking to popular bars, restaurants, and a promenade area that we visited both nights of our stay. You can see Mount Vesuvius from harbour view rooms, bar and pool.",95
Modern Hotel in Ancient Naples,40,Date of stay: May 2019,"I chose the Romeo for its nearness to the ferries going to Sorrento as I had planned a day excursion. But I chose it also for its commanding views of Mt. Vesuvius and Capri, both of which I could see from my waterfront room. The weather was overcast dimming the views, but the design and comfort of the room made up for this disappointment. The staff in all areas we used were extraordinarily gracious and helpful. Breakfast was a delight.",77
Convenient for One Night,50,Date of stay: May 2019,"This hotel was conveniently located for us taking a Ferry into town, and was an easy walk to the airport shuttle the next morning. Bonus: the shuttle was quiet and everyone that got on at the port got a seat, and on board (vs the train station guests, some of which were told the bus was full). The hotel staff were lovely and were able to help us with everything we needed. We enjoyed the perks of booking directly through the hotel - free access to the spa downstairs and a treat in the room. We were on our honeymoon, and enjoyed the bottle of Prosecco they brought up! The only negative was that housekeeping came to knock on our door quite late (10 PM) when we were already in bed before our morning flight. However, for a one night stop over, I would return to this hotel.",18
Odd experience,30,Date of stay: May 2019,"Ours was a one night stopover before catching our flight home. The hotel is in an odd location overlooking part of the docks - not a particularly pleasant area. The foyer was large with some interesting water features, but the actual reception area was small, with barely enough space for a couple of customers at a time. Our room was on the third floor, and a very helpful member of staff explained it's features. It was of adequate size for an overnight stay, but it had very odd bathroom arrangements. The bathroom area was all frosted glass with sliding doors which separated it from the sleeping area. The lights were automatic on some sort of movement sensor, but the time delay was quite short, so they kept going off before you were ready. Not a problem most of the time, but could…",40
Cannot recommend,20,Date of stay: May 2019,"A disappointment because an article of clothing left behind in a room could not be retrieved even after one night. Housekeeping should have been able to find a black pair of pants, but after phone calls and emails, we have heard nothing. Very disappointing.",3
Good as usual,50,Date of stay: May 2019,"Fifth time in hotel. Hotel become better and better each time. They read our reviews) perfect staff, very good breakfasts with nice Vesuvius view. Very close to port to travel to Amalfi,Sorrento, Capri",42
Lovely refuge in a gritty city,50,Date of stay: May 2019,"I had a relaxing stay at this property. Perks included the rooftop pool, solid gym facility and breakfast with a view. The one annoyance I can point to are the automated lights in sections of the rooms. One can't make a trip to the bathroom without triggering bright lights that illuminate the entire room because the bathroom ""walls"" are glass. Who thought of that one? And the AC didn't have an auto setting, which made it hard to regulate. Either it was on or off.",41
Short visit in town,50,Date of stay: May 2019,"I visited Napoli because I was looking for a sunny escape. Well the weather wasn’t that warm but the people and the city are warm enough! Nice escape in the south. La città ha tante sfaccettature, la zona del porto non è tra le più curate o belle però appunto tutto attorno è invitante.",6
Short overnight stay,40,Date of stay: May 2019,On out way to the Amalfi coast. Location feels weird at first ( facing a run down warehouse) but turns out to be convenient to walk around the city as well as to get to/out of when visiting the region. The room ( junior suite corner harbour view) was nuce and well appointed. The bed was very good.Service at breakfast was not great. Long wait and pear juice never came. The worst part was the valet parking. We waited 35 mns to get our car and we realized when we parked again it had been scratched.. Not great.,1
the worse 5 star???? Hotel we have ever stayed at,10,Date of stay: May 2019,"Booking the hotel room we anticipated sea views, balcony and a spaciuos room. None of which were on offer. Hugely disappointed. We paid 360.00 euros for 1 night in a room situated at the back of the hotel with a view over looking a dissuesd building and massive metal tower which I assumed was some form of communication pole? However when I complained to the receptionist who showed us the room he tried to justify our rate paid only warranted this type of room and of course they were fully booked so apparently couldn't move us but offered that should we wish to leave we wouldn't be charged. Due to the lateness of our arrival we had to stay but with a heavy heart? The facilities on offer were a 2 hour window in their spa. I had to halt one treatment as the therapist had a really…",22
Wonderful!,50,Date of stay: April 2019,"Beautiful hotel, great location, great restaurant, wonderful service. We stayed only 1 night but wished we had stayed longer. We ate breakfast & dinner in the restaurant on the 9th floor - very nice experience and very good views. Rooms were roomy, clean and well appointed.",13
Comfy stay in Naples,40,Date of stay: April 2019,The location of the hotel is perfect if you traveling around the area and taking ferrys. Its not a picturesque view so I wouldn't choose a room based on that. We stayed with 2 kids in one room and it was a bit tight however the hotel was nice enough to add an extra roll out bed. Breakfast is very nice and has something for everyone.,43
The Arsenal supporters group..,50,Date of stay: April 2019,"We stayed for two nights and received superb service from the moment we were met from or car at the roadside. Good humoured, polite and efficient staff at the door, the reception desk, speed of luggage delivery, in the bar and in the roof top Michelin stared restaurant where we were wowed by the 8 course tasting menu with wine flight. Not inexpensive but simply wonderful. Comfortable, well equipped rooms completed the package. We all had a fantastic time at the Romeo ...... and Arsenal won!",7
Amazing hotel,50,Date of stay: April 2019,"This was one of the best hotels I’ve stayed at. The workers, spa, bar and pool were well beyond average. The location is right on the water next to the ferry line and multiple restaurants. I would highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Naples!",2
Dissapointed,40,Date of stay: April 2019,"A lovely looking hotel with views to the port, it's not in a particularly nice position,quite an industrial looking area, there are nicer places to stay and since been back the nicer areas are no more expensive, the staff here are great, reception staff really helpful,the restaurant staff were great and Antonio in the lobby had was fantastic, it lived up to its 5* rating but in other ways it lets itself down, 3 light bulbs out in room, on our first night we got back to our room about 10.30ish to find we couldn't get into our room, I sent down to reception to report this and was immediately escorted back to the room by the gentleman on the desk, it turned out that the lock was shattered! Which was quite worrying as this must have taken some force, we were told this happens!, we…",50
Amazing,50,Date of stay: September 2018,We had an amazing stay at the Romeo hotel. Its stylish and offers a rooftop pool with jacuzzi with harbour views. The staff was nice and the breakfast delicious. Our room was big and everything is very modern with well picked interior. Whenever we are in Naples that is the place to stay for us.,251
Romeo was excellent,50,Date of stay: April 2019,"Loved our stay at Romeo in Naples. The whole experience is pretty funky and interesting but at the heart of it is a well managed hotel which caters to every need. We found the concierge staff amazing and were all over places to see, dinner reservations, travel bookings and general assistance. The guy (sorry I don’t know your name) who managed the arrival/departure process was amazing, always helpful throughout our stay.",1
Girls trip,50,Date of stay: April 2019,"We went to Naples for a mother/daughter trip to see Pompeii & Naples. Our room was comfortable & clean. Unfortunately we couldn't get the rain shower to operate but the hand held shower was fine. The restaurant was lovely, in particular the fish. Staff were very helpful and friendly and speak English very well. The location is handy to the port for visiting The Amalfi Coast & Capri. Most points of interest, cafes, reastaurants & shops are about a 15 min walk.",4
Oasis in Naples!,50,Date of stay: March 2019,"This hotel was my favorite part about staying in Naples! Naples is not my type of city. Crossing the street was stressful, there was trash everywhere and there is tagging on all the buildings. I see great bones in the city, but somehow things have not been maintained. The one reason to visit Naples is to eat pizza and tons of it! If you do decide to stay in Naples like we did, this hotel is where you should stay. The hotel is close to a subway and was easily walkable to many sites. The hotel was clean, with great facilities and staff. The staff was helpful in making reservations and suggestions for sightseeing. The food was great. Breakfast was my favorite part of the day. The breakfast is served on the 9th floor with a nice view of the harbor. There was also a pool…",18

25th anniversary long weekend,50,Date of stay: March 2019,"We enjoyed the hotel and the staff. Your evening doorman was very helpful and gave us great recommendations for restaurants. The spa was excellent and your Michelin starred resuaurant was very good. Our only concern: your wi-fi is terrible. We had to sit by the door of our room to get any reception, there is no excuse for this in 2019.",3
Beautiful hotel,50,Date of stay: March 2019,"We had a splendid time in this beautiful place . Fantastic spa ! We loved the design and atmosphere of all the different places in the hotel , from reception to various bars and restaurants. Outside pool is wonderful.",9
"Not exactly 5 star, dated ""modern"" hotel",20,Date of stay: April 2019,"Good points: friendly staff, good food at restaurants (only had breakfast and dinner at their rooftop/pool restaurant, not the Michelin star restaurant); rooftop pool is more of a small plunge pool/hot tub, but nice asset but likely crowded during summer (so small). Not good: hotel rooms are frankly dated, not modern. Lighting system is a joke - if you want to be 'modern', install ""smart"" ipad-like functionality. There needs to be electrical outlets at bedside, not below the bedside table (this is basic, not ""5-star""). The bathrooms are not 5-star: too cramp, awkward ""see-through"" doors. Poor, poor, poor lighting - 5-star hotel 101: lighting is key!! Our breakfast came with room rate, but other guests told us the cost was 30-40 Euro - sorry, not worth it. The worst:…",5
Well below standard,10,Date of stay: April 2019,"Breakfast was terrible, served the usual trays of baked sausages and ""bacon"" couldn't even scramble an egg properly, they were split and grainy in the tray. The sauna in the wellness room didn't work properly and barely got over 25°c no sound proofing in the rooms either so using the blue tooth stereo system was pretty much out of the question. The steam shower was clearly in need of maintenance too, it made the whole room smell of rotten eggs whenever the steam function was turned on. Plus the location of the hotel is appalling, its right outside the ferry docks so all you can see of the harbour is great ugly ferries and a tonne of traffic with the industrial port right next to it. So cranes and storage containers everywhere. It was too dark in the hotel to boot, everything was…",2
Perfection,50,Date of stay: April 2019,"I cannot lie, I’m a little spoilt and I like a bit of luxury- this hotel did not disappoint. All weekend I kept asking “how would I fault this hotel” and I couldn’t find anything! We stayed in the wellness room, which was impressive in size and facility. It was like having our own apartment. It is the hotel that keeps on giving, with loads of little freebies eg. Soap, shampoo, pens, chocolates, hand cream, lip balm, slippers, and the tiny attention to detail was so impressive, ( we even joked that every day was a brand new toilet roll - covered in the Romeo hotel covering) The cleaning of the room was second to none- and I am picky! Service was spectacular, friendly and efficient. I loved the decor and all the quirky gadgets. It was hi tec and had a real feel of 5 star…",23
Modern high quality but,40,Date of stay: March 2019,"Stayed 4 nights with the family. Got a J suite and another room. The hotel is ultra modern but being that the maintenance has since failed to keep up the systems. The bathrooms have automatic sensors and when you get into the shower the lights turns off after a while... the bath in the J suite takes ages to fill up as no water pressure, the curtains automatic but probably have not been services and oiled as they should. The breakfast is great, the stuff is super helpful and attentive and the lobby, the breakfast room and the restaurant are impressive so with a little effort re maintenance they can be much better.",150
mini break,50,Date of stay: February 2019,"The hotel was wonderful, incredibly friendly and helpful staff - had a terrific stay. We enjoyed the space and the facilities. Concierge was great for dinner recommendations. The location made it easy to get the boat to go and visit other islands.",1
Your restaurant,20,Date of stay: February 2019,"Two days in advance we asked for a table in the front row. We were told that this is im possible. In the evening other costumeres refused a table in the second row, they then got a table in the front row. We have noted this as strange habibts for hotel guests. We were also disturbed by other guests who were smoking. Your restaurant cannot be recommended,",1
Lovely Stay in Napoli,50,Date of stay: November 2018,"We had a lovely stay at this hotel. We had a view of the water and Vesuvius. Granted the immediate waterfront is not as scenic, but we enjoyed our view. It was an easy walk to the ferry, which we took to Sorrento. The area immediately around the hotel was very clean and felt safe. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The food recommendations were great. We also enjoyed an evening in the spa, which was incredibly relaxing.",10
"Beautiful spa, friendly employees, good food",40,Date of stay: February 2019,"Romeo Hotel really earns its ""five-star L"" rating. Employees are well-trained and very helpful. While we did not eat at the top-floor restaurant (the menu wasn't attractive to us: beef testicles, etc.) we did enjoy the food and views at Beluga. The lobby bar is skillfully manned in the evenings by Antonio, who was always a pleasure. One minor irritant in the room was a glass-walled bathroom with a bright motion-activated light. This basically turns the bathroom into a giant lantern when anyone uses the bathroom at night. It lights up the whole room, and can really disturb your sleep. Another oddity was the lack of air conditioning. True, we were there in February and one would expect that AC wouldn't be a necessary amenity in the cold weather. However, our room was…",70
Stunning Luxury and Elegance,50,Date of stay: March 2019,"This is my 2nd visit to this hotel. Staying in a different room type. Previously a Corner suite this time a front facing room. Both are amazing and the space in the room is ample for 2 travellers with large cases. The staff are quick very helpful. Both times we have contacted the hotel for help on excursions prior to arrival and they more than helpful. Everyone can speak English which is helpful. The decor is the best feature the waterfall in reception, the lovely flavoured water and small cakes available all the time. Bars great. Can't wait for a 3rd visit. But the quriky bits of art are the best like staying in a gallery.",25
Long weekend in Naples,50,Date of stay: February 2019,"Everything about this hotel was amazing! Located across from the harbor area with a view of Mt. Vesuvius and Capri, this luxury boutique hotel is only a few minutes walk from the old city and many of the city's sights. The interior is modern and inviting with Japanese inspired design elements, and offers multiple bars, rooftop dining and pool, and a gym and spa (we did not eat at the restaurant or enjoy the spa or gym). The breakfast buffet is very nice, offering views of Mt Vesuvius and with coffee and eggs made to order. We booked a deluxe room with a harbor view, which was roomy and comfortable with a king size bed and walk in shower (the bathroom design is a bit queer in that you must walk through the toilet room to access the shower). All of the exceptional staff are…",154
Good but could be great.,40,Date of stay: February 2019,Your staff needs to learn from other five star hotels about being accommodating to guests. NO is never the right answer. And lighten up a bit. Everyone wants to have fun. Room was very nice but frankly noisy. Freaks and cracks and the lighting while unique is difficult to control and turns off automatically too soon. The timing needs to be adjusted.,2
Best in Naples,50,Date of stay: February 2019,"Location a little off centre but you can still walk around - Romeo is still best in Naples by far A bit overpriced for what you get though, for a winter low season rate I was surprised at the costs. The quality and interiors is much higher standard than most other Naples hotels",13
Gem hidden in plain sight,50,Date of stay: February 2019,"Boutique hotel in harbor.. unusual microlocation, off the main Napoli atractions or neighborhoods, but close to all the best places. Most importantly, gorgeus little hotel with artworks in the lobby, cigar room with best ventilation ever, amazing cactuses colection arround the hotel and on the bar/pool area... View of Vesuvius in the morning from the room, restaurant and the pool... But best of all, amazing staff eager to make you feel welcomed and ready to explain all you want to know about the place, city, culture, cuisine.. from doorman to restaurant staff, management, room service... all in all, must stay place when in Napoli :)",9
amazing birthday holiday,50,Date of stay: January 2019,"The hotel has been highly recommended to us by a good friend Mr. Francesco Lo Regio from Hilton Lake Como. Wonderful experience from the first moment I reserved the Hotel. Willing to help for any inquiry, fulfilled every wish. My husband celebrated his birthday upon arrival we have been honored by an upgrade. A cake with birthday candle has been brought to our room. The staff is excellent beginning from the ladies in the guest relations deparment, Aura and Sara. The staff at the reception Luca, Tina, Alehandro, Fillipo and the staff in during breakfast time especially Francesco!!!

Business and relax,50,Date of stay: February 2019,"On my first time in Naples I choose to stay in Romeo Hotel not far from downtown just few minutes walking. Inside you could find in every corner pieces of modern art and antique souvenirs from Japan mixed together. The room was spectacular (bed with 6 pillows!!), nice view over the harbour. One of the two restaurants was closed for holidays (""Il Comandante"" * Michelin star), so I tried on the 9th floor where also breakfast is served in the morning. Service was fast and at breakfast there's a buffet with a wide range of choice. They serve also at tables the magical ""sfogliatella"" typical neapolitan pastry they are mindblowing. One of the waiters was very kind and gave me one to eat during the flight thanks Francesco. One of the best hotels i've never stayed. Thanks a lot.",2
What a great hotel is supposed to be.,50,Date of stay: January 2019,"Romeo just gets it right. It gets everything right. Design is spectacular. Fun. Colorful. A bit on the edge, tastefully. Rooms are well designed. Spacious. Reliable internet. Too many pillows (a great thing). Cool bathrooms. Great water pressure. Other posts talk about being disappointed with the view. Ask for a high floor for a better view. The restaurants and the pool on the top two floors won’t disappoint. Location sems odd for a first time visitor to Naples, but as soon as you get your bearings, you understand how well situated the hotel really is. I can’t wait to come back and take some day trips, leaving from the ferry terminal right across the street. Everyone working at the Romeo is wonderful. Really wonderful. Oh, and the Spa. It’s gorgeous, creatively designed,…",27
Stay,50,Date of stay: January 2019,"Stay was nice, however room was a bit pricey. Staff members were great and helpful. The vallet was a great bonus as well. As we all no parking outside in Naples is rough. Overall I had a great experience which was the highlight of my New Year.",1
Doesn't live up to the price,30,Date of stay: January 2019,"I've stayed in some great hotels and, at the price, I was hoping this would be another. It was not. The room felt small for a junior suite (largely poor use of space, but you can just stick in a couple of seats and think that justifies the term), the wifi was intermittent and the water-pressure in the shower was disappointing. None of these, you may say, are major issues, which is true, but at the price there shouldn't be any glitches. Breakfast, meanwhile, was laughably overpriced for a disappointing buffet with weak coffee - it was €10 if you wanted cheese.",106
Fantastic hotel,50,Date of stay: November 2018,"Fabulous hotel, beautiful decor and staff couldn’t have been nicer. It’s a pity it’s in such a run down part of the city but saying that, Naples in its entirety is rundown! If ever back in Naples it’s the only hotel to stay in.",6
Thanksgiving Holiday in Napoli at the Romeo,40,Date of stay: November 2018,"My husband and I had a nice stay at the Romeo... it was the off-season, so the hotel was really quiet. The highlight of the hotel was the staff - everyone was such a pleasure to talk with and incredibly helpful. The studio corner room had a beautiful view, the shower and soaking tub were relaxing, and we received sweet gifts from the hotel with the turn down service every night. Only complaint about the room was that the closet doors had a poor design that made opening and closing it a loud hassle, and we wished we had more drawers for clothes. The spa was serene, and a nice place to warm up after chilly winter weather. Our biggest disappointment was that the pool and poolside bar were closed our entire visit. It was one of the reasons we paid a premium to stay here, so we were…",4
Amazing,40,Date of stay: December 2017,"It has been more than a year ago but I never written a review. And they definitely deserve one. The experience we had at this hotel was just amazing. Unfortunately it rained the day we got there and I believe the day we left but it was a short 3day stay. But in the meantime we enjoyed the restaurant which had amazing wines and staff. Very nice city, beautiful room. I tell my girlfriend each time i think back that we most definitely should return once more to that great Romeo hotel. There was an issue with the bathroom that kept leaking. Which was annoying especially because the way they handled it at the time wasn’t good. But apparently all was forgotten. Also close by the city of Pompeii.",55
Something Special,50,Date of stay: November 2018,"We can't say anything but thank you for making our stay unforgettable. The city of Naples is really magical; you have to live this city to understand what I mean. The Romeo Hotel is all you deserve for your trip in Naples; an excellent reception full of young and smiling employers, fantastic modern room with breathtaking view on the gulf and cruise ships, but on the top I surely put the two restaurants, especially with the Breakfast service, amazing food quality, superb espresso coffee (coffee addicted here). On this I want to highlight the service really lovely, thanks to Mrs. Iolanda and Mr. Francesco they are two waiters that every luxury hotels need to have on team. See you on our next trip to Naples!",1
Excellent hotel in Napli,50,Date of stay: October 2018,"Starting from e-mail correspondences, I felt everything was organized and efficient. All staffs from the bell and front to restaurant were nice and friendly. The restaurant, Il Comandante is ""must"" visit.",2

Wonderful Hotel,50,Date of stay: October 2018,"The Romeo Naples is probably located in the best location in Naples, especially if your plans include taking a Ferry to Ischia or Capri. It's basically just across the street from the Ferry Terminal. The rooms are perfectly appointed and very comfortable. The lobby has some of the most interesting art pieces. They have a Pool Table, Slot Machine and a Foosball Table. The Rooftop Pool is a perfect place to unwind after touring with amazing views of Mount Vesuvius and Capri. Their Michelin Star Restaurant ""IL Comandante"" was such a treat! Delicious Food and impeccable service. The front desk staff were very accommodating. My group had an early morning flight and they prepared each and everyone of us a ""Breakfast Box"" to go since their Restaurant wasn't open that early.",1
Honeymoon stay,40,Date of stay: July 2018,"Stayed here in July for 2 nights on our trip of Italy for our honeymoon. Modern hotel in a good location to have a look round Naples. Staff were friendly. We only visited the the restaurant for one drink as we found it to be overpriced and waited to long for a drink when there was only one other couple in the restaurant. Room was lovely, modern and spacious and clean. It was my husbands birthday while at the hotel and they gave him a birthday card and cake for when we returned to the room which was a lovely touch.",124
Long weekend break,40,Date of stay: October 2018,"Lovely hotel, attentive and helpful staff....downstairs barman serves a fantastic cosmopolitan. We had breakfast once...a bit pricey for what you get if I'm honest so we had breakfast out for the rest of our stay. We had two evening meals which were both very good. Nice surprise birthday cake in our room which was a nice touch. Give the lady that cleans the rooms a big fat bonus this year...she was excellent.",2
"Cheap interiour, nice spa",40,Date of stay: October 2018,The walls in the room were all out of plastic and not nice material. The Spa was nice and good service. The pool on the rood is cool but it needs to be repaired a bit. Selection of drinks was good and the service on the roof too. We would appreciate a shuttle service to the airport.,1
A great spot,50,Date of stay: October 2018,"We had a comfortable refuge in a busy city. Great location, close to the heart of the town with a wonderful view of the port of Naples, Mt Vesuvius and the bay from the rooftop bar. Rooms were quite large, as were the bathrooms. Modern, yet inviting. Lovely staff, particularly good service after our checkout as we were allowed to utilize the hotel facilities in the afternoon and later into the evening before our late train. Overall, we had a great stay and would go back again.",3
Just not quite there for a hotel in this price category.,30,Date of stay: October 2018,"This hotel was chosen for its location, which was good. Close enough to the tourist sites to walk there without the need for a taxi. The room was very spacious and for the most part comfortable. The waiters at lunch were very friendly and the food was good. However, there were things that left me disappointed as a guest - light switches too complicated; sockets underneath bedside table (and this is a brand new hotel - who wants to have to crouch down underneath to try to charge a phone?); shower did not work properly and shower cubicle was not sealed properly and so it leaked into WC cubicle next door); enormous pillows that were just not comfortable; super expensive breakfast. All in all, it was just not quite there for a hotel in this price category.",4
A great choice in Naples,50,Date of stay: October 2018,"The hotel is a great starting point for getting to know Naples and the attractive region (Capri, Pompeij, Ercolano, Ravello, Sorrento, Amalfi etc.). Especially the rooftop bar and the restaurant are a welcomed places to relax. The staff of the hotel is excellent, helpful and very polite. You feel at home. We will be back.",4
Design hotel......hmmm.....poor execution,20,Date of stay: October 2018,"Very disappointing choice. Definitely will find another place in the city next time. Apparently a design hotel but the aesthetics did not resonate with me. Decor trying too hard. Eclectic random stuff thrown together. Expensive room and yet nothing quite worked. Over priced certainly. Location not great either. In theory overlooks the Bay but actually looks down at the lorries waiting to load in the harbour, the cruise ships and the car parks. Not much nearby. Not good execution inside either. Simple order of lunch on rooftop took too long despite restaurant being almost empty. Woke around 5.30 am because of a hotel power cut that turned off the air conditioning and turned on the emergency lights in the bedroom. So impossible to get back to sleep. Electrics all…",9
A very enjoyable stay - and great food!,50,Date of stay: September 2018,"We were very pleased to have chosen the Romeo hotel for our 5 night stay in Naples. It is very well located opposite the port where most forms of transport can be found. The hotel is not a cheap option, but we took advantage of the hotel's offer of 5 nights for the price of four and felt it was well worth the money. We chose a Deluxe room at the back of the hotel with views of the Charterhouse, and we had no street noise and no noise from other rooms. The decor is modern and clean, the beds comfortable and the shower good. The hotel offers a change of towels twice a day and dispenses free water every evening as well as a gift of chocolates on arrival. The staff are friendly and helpful. Then there is the food! First breakfast - this was included in our room rate and is served in…",619
5 STAR FACILITIES 3 STAR SERVICE,40,Date of stay: October 2018,"While the facilities are stunning, The service was very average. 5 star hotels are supposed to have 24 your room service BUT when calling for room service at 12:30 they hung up on us twice and then the third time explained they were out of food and no food was available. Many of the staff had trouble communicating in English They also served me a “pomegranate smoothie” from a carton . I expect a 5 Star Hotel to make a fresh smoothie BUT I must say the Spa & facilities are truly AMAZING!!",77
Wellsness Room Receives 5 Star Review,50,Date of stay: September 2018,"The Wellness room is well worth it - the Wellness room (bathroom/spa) is larger than the bedroom. It includes a huge tub, blue light room shower, pulley system for some exercising and a large yoga ball.The staff is fluent in english.Bars on the 1st and 9th floorA Michelin star restaurant on the 10th and a wine list that is beyond belief.While you dine you view Vt VesuviusA few blocks away is Gran Gusto - 2nd floor wine shop is one of the best in Italy",3
Excellent Hotel,50,Date of stay: September 2018,We had a wonderful experience. The staff was so helpful and accommodating. Although it is on a busy street it is close to wonderful restaurants and local shopping. Right by the water which I’m is great! Would absolutely stay here again.,2
pretty decor,50,Date of stay: September 2018,Enjoyed the proximity to the ferry to and from Capri. within walking distance of port .the hotel was clean and had beautiful decor. wish I could have eaten in the restaurant on the 10th floor. wonderful breakfast and the views were terrific fronm the pool.,2
Excellent Naples Hotel,50,Date of stay: September 2018,"A first class hotel , with excellent service - the room we stayed in was very clean and and of a high standard, offering great amenities - the restaurant was of a high standard, and the staff were excellent and couldn’t be more helpful - my wife and I had a great visit and felt safe and secure in a beautiful modern hotel.",2
Pleasant Stay in Naples,40,Date of stay: September 2018,"The Romeo hotel was gorgeous. Naples is a but run down compared to some other cities in Italy, but the Romeo hotel was a beautiful luxury hotel. The staff was polite and attentive. The spa was great to enjoy, however I don't know if I would pay 90 euros a day for it (it was included with our room), and the dinner at the terrace restaurant was delicious. Although we didn't have a room with a water view, the room was still large and spacious. I would recommend this hotel.",1
Stay here and get fleeced!,10,Date of stay: September 2018,"This hotel truly lives up to the expectation of being “fleeced in Naples”. We arrived on a late night flight into Naples with the intention of staying the night and leaving in the morning to go to the Amalfi Coast. The king size room was prepaid months in advance. We were told it’s “illegal” in Italy to sleep on a king size bed with your child and “we must get an upgrade to a bigger room or go away”. This was at nearly midnight and the manager well and truly knew we had no other option but to pay the difference - which turned out to be 460 Euros in addition to the nearly 400 Euros already paid for a one night stay! If we didn’t pay the full amount we’d have had to leave! Imagine midnight in Naples, tired child and suitcases with nowhere to go - the hotel staff didn’t care at…",17
Faded ultra modern glory,30,Date of stay: September 2018,"This is an ultra modern hotel with lots of glass, stylish furnishings and esthetic fixtures, but style seems to have won out over function. The lighting system is so complex that it took us several minutes each night to figure out how to get all the lights turned off. One evening we left the closet door open and every time one of us rolled over in bed, the motion activated closet light would turn on. The rooms and bathrooms are “compact”, a polite way of saying “small”. For a five star hotel, it’s getting a little rough around the edges. Chips on some of the furnishings, snags on the curtains and housekeeping had to be called one day to change our towels and provide turn down service. Took 40 minutes to get the car from parking. The breakfast was overpriced and the food wasn’t…",23
Modern,50,Date of stay: September 2018,"Beautiful hotel for a quick change of pace. While our trip was mostly historically based, our stay at hotel Romeo was a wonderful snap back to the modern world before heading back to the US. The rooms were lovely and clean, the gym and spa are wonderful amenities. We unfortunately did not get to experience the complimentary breakfast as our flight was too early.",1
Nice hotel - average location,40,Date of stay: August 2018,"My wife and I stayed for 4 days during our European holiday. The hotel was quirky, pleasant, and loved the various chic statues etc. the staff were pleasant and attentive. Check in was smooth and staff accompanied us to our room and explained everything, including how to use the shower. We had a junior suite that was spacious, comfortable and well equipped. The breakfast on the top level was very nice with a great outlook, staff efficient and pleasant. Happy with the hotel, but on a main drag, and nothing much around, had to walk 15 mins or so to the action of Naples. I would stay here again, but was not keen on Naples. I will stay in Sorrento next time.",29
An absolute dream of a hotel!,50,Date of stay: September 2018,"Stayed 2 nights at this amazing hotel before going on to Procida From the moment I arrived it was like living a dream! Staff could not have been anymore wonderful. Spent time laying by the amazing rooftop pool, with views over Vesuvius and the bay of Naples with a cocktail (or 3!) Room was perfect (front deluxe) and lots of special little touches that were very thoughtful (chocolates, bottled water, slippers, coffee machine...) Would love to go back soon. Well worth every penny.",154
Passing through,40,Date of stay: September 2018,Very nice hotel although not cheap. An amazing interior with both restaurants overlooking the Bay of Naples. Food was good. The rooms were well furnished and quiet considering it is close to the main road near the docks. It would be a good location if you are planning to catch cruise ship from here Recommended.,26
Excellent Hotel,50,Date of stay: September 2018,"My friend and myself enjoyed a 3 night stay at this lovely hotel. The twin room was excellent and a lovely view over the port looking towards Versuvius. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was fabulous, lots of choice. The location was ideal for the train station and ferry to get to places, such as Sorrento. I would recommend this hotel highly.. would definitely visit again..",1
5 day stay,40,Date of stay: September 2018,Location is ideal on waterfront. Alibus airport shuttle stop located nearby. Hotel is perfect for access to ferries from Molo Beverollo. Staff are very professional and breakfast was a daily highlight both for the food and the spectacular views over the bay. The rooftop pool is but a plunge pool and is not suitable for a swimmer. There is only a limited number of sun loungers by the pool. The only downside to our stay was that the hotel failed to rectify a faulty shower in our room after a number of requests.,62
Excessively priced for what you get,20,Date of stay: September 2018,"Decent hotel and good location but priced excessively high. Better value elsewhere, probably less money spent on 'design' in the hotel of course...Furthermore:1) credit card overcharged by close to 2.000 Euro and a pain to get this corrected2) is access to iron/ironing board really too much to ask for when paying >400 euro / night? when all that is needed is a quick 30 second ironing it's absurd to expect guests to pay for external service to do this",7
Amazing Hotel,50,Date of stay: August 2018,"We stayed in the Wellness Suite, it was incredible. We both remarked that we have never seen a hotel room like it, it was absolutely stunning, relaxing and so much fun. The steam room in the room was awesome. The spa in the hotel was amazing too. So beautiful and refreshing. I truly think this is the best hotel to stay in in Naples.",3
Perfect,50,Date of stay: August 2018,Beautiful stylish hotel well placed within walking distance to the key areas to see. Everyone was super helpful. They made all of the arrangements I needed especially the taxi to the airport at 4:30 am. Bed was comfortable with a view of the port.,3
Such a shame...,30,Date of stay: August 2018,"Recently departed the Romeo Hotel with mixed views after a 4 night stay. Pros: Nice room (corner suite I think?) Friendly staff and plenty of them Efficient and helpful check in taking us to our room and pointing out the facilities Fantastic decor, facilities and high level fittings I.e. Reception, bar area, restaurant Cons: Why oh why the need to charge crazy prices for drinks? I totally understand the logic and need to charge a premium for F&B, but not to the extent at present. End result was an empty bar EVERY day and evening. Such a fantastic bar area and setting but why would I want to spend upwards of £50 for the cheapest bottle of wine or £15-£20 for a cocktail when they're half or a quarter of the price a stones throw away in a great restaurant?! 5* hotel with no iron…",25
Not too bad... not too great.,30,Date of stay: August 2018,"So my girlfriend and I literally left Naples and this hotel this morning. Back in UK now so best to review whilst still fresh. I’m not about to completely bad mouth the hotel but there are areas for DEFINITE improvement. Namely getting rid of a couple of employees that drag the standards down! Yes... the hotel is fancy with art installations and nice decor. Yes... there is a Michelin star restaurant there. ( which we didn’t bother with) However... we ate in the Beluga restaurant at least once a day and I can say without a shadow of a doubt... the ladies are mostly 5* for service. Namely - Loredana, Silvana, Francesca and one other I didn’t catch the name of. They seemed to work mostly in the daytime and were fantastic. Excellent service and always friendly. On the…",1
Birthday getaway,30,Date of stay: August 2018,"On arrival we were greeted by a friendly doorman and the check-in procedure was quick and they were very helpful. Beluga. The restaurant on the 9th floor was disappointing in so many ways, terrible cocktails, basic menu options. We organized a birthday dinner for my boyfriend and his friends. Slow service. Drinks took forever to arrive. Order was completely shambled as some main courses came before starters. Food portions were tiny and there weren’t any carbs or vegetables with meat and fish dishes. Desserts were disgusting. Oh and breakfast also terrible. Ordered eggs Benedict with rye toast, got two tiny pieces of wheat bread. The spa on the other hand was a lovely experience, ladies were helpful, attentive and did a great job. The hotel in general is just so over priced…",30
Stunning luxury art hotel.,50,Date of stay: August 2018,"Highly recommend if staying in Naples. This hotel has it all, great roof top pool and restaurants. Great lobby bar and stunning art throughout the place. The spa area under the hotel is stunning, something I have never experienced, with a multitude of different saunas, steam rooms and plunge pools. Truly worth staying at this hotel for this alone. The rooms are very nice and luxurious, perfect for us after 3 weeks on the road around Italy. Oh, the staff are truly outstanding and attentive. Food and drinks were great. Top marks all around.",70
Buyer beware.,10,Date of stay: June 2018,"When booking online, we specifically selected a room with a view, described as “luxury accommodation featuring views of the harbour, Gulf of Naples, and Mt. Vesuvius"" for the last nights of our honeymoon. We paid extra for the view. We could have stayed anywhere in Naples, but specifically selected this hotel for the harbor views. Please see attached photo for the “view” from our room. Second floor above a loud six-lane highway, extremely dirty window, view of an industrial shipping complex. No harbor, no gulf, no Mt. Vesuvius. The worst part was that when we pointed this out to the concierge, they were hardly apologetic. They did not offer an upgrade or anything to compensate. They claimed no other rooms were available, although the hotel was showing availability online.…",13
Beautiful Hotel with Excellent Staff,40,Date of stay: August 2018,"We stayed here for 3 nights and loved every minute. Good location for the promenade, the egg castle and the train station. The staff were very friendly and polite, spoke excellent English and were only too happy to help with any request. The decor in the communal areas was modern and sleek, the beds are very comfortable, there is a rooftop pool and a choice of restaurants. The view of Mount Vesuvius from the pool terrace and restaurant is a beautiful backdrop for drinks, breakfast or lunch. I read an earlier review where a Gentleman complained that the view wasn’t good because of the Port. Whilst the Port is certainly not attractive, it’s not really something the hotel can do a lot about. The view from the higher floors almost blocks out the port and provides a beautiful view…",123
SLH and 5 start hotel - must be a printing error,20,Date of stay: July 2018,"SLH and 5 start hotel - this must be a printing error. It might be so that the 5 start was valid 15 years ago, but not today. The overall design was old fashioned and in general worn out. The see view room was over a unclean parking place and a lot of rusty boat containers with a glimpse of see view. The ""good thing"" was that the windows were dirty so you did not really have to the the poor seaview. However, wery good beds/room AC and sleeping quality and the staff was really good and helpfull.",6
July stay,50,Date of stay: July 2018,"We had an excellent time. The staff was very accommodating and helpful. The location was perfect for our needs and allowed us access to the ferry to and from Capri. We will return again as business will bring us back. When in Naples, that's our home!",1
Current Boutique Hotel in Naples,50,Date of stay: July 2018,"Very Hipster vibe. Lobby, staff and first impressions were perfect. Our rooms were EXTREMELY spacious, clean, and very comfortable. Our room included a nice oversized tub which was so nice after two weeks of European travel and being on a riverboat for 7 days. The spa treatment/ massage was one of the best I've ever had anywhere. The spa was so unique and beautiful and offered many pools and steam options. very serene, even down to the beautiful music.",5
Lovely hotel,40,Date of stay: July 2018,"A lovely hotel, the rooms are clean, beds are comfy. The pool was a little disappointing as no sun after 2/3ish and limited loungers. The upstairs bar was big but cold in the evening (too much air con). Found there wasn’t anywhere to sit outside in the evening for a drink. Drinks always came with so many snacks, but I think these were reused as once were very stale and that put me off eating again. The service was hit and miss, the spa was amazing and really nice to relax in but was told they ran out of towels and we had to go and get some from our room. Also closes at 9 but they were blowing out candles, making us feel like we should leave around 8 one evening. Bar downstairs again service could be extremely slow to make a drink or even pour a coke, waited about 20mins one…",5
Perfect Stay,50,Date of stay: July 2018,"The arrival was very pleasant - our luggage was taken over as we left the Taxi and we had to care about nothing. Check in was quick and the really polite FO agent brought is into our room, explaining the Hotel and the Rooms advantages very well. We really felt like Kings in our new Castle. The room was very well designed and very clean!!! Very friendly and caring housekeeping - thank You so much - the staff of the breakfast Restaurant and the bar are the nicest crew we ever Met in a Hotel!!! It was like your Mum saw all your wishes in your eyes.... we got so much support to „create“ Birthday bash breakfast in our room. The Cocktails at night by the Pool were also great! The view is Perfect at every time of the day. Unfortunately we had to leave - But we will be back soon!!!!!!",19
Good but not professional,30,Date of stay: July 2018,"The rooms was clean, calm and safe.4/5 I booked a sea view rooms. but it’s not, most likely to be Factories or port view. There was a welcoming chocolate in the rooms. For the location it’s Not bad.3/5 Reception staff helpful not professional:3.6/5 The breakfast very Few options.The staff was slow.2/5 Very bad WiFi !!!0/5",16
Great hotel and close the the docks!,40,Date of stay: July 2018,"We chose this place as we were taking the ferry to Capri the next morning - 5min walk. It is a really nice hotel and offers pool, chess, foosball in the lobby. It also has a Michelin star restaurant on the 10th floor. The staff are friendly and also offers parking for about 15 euros per day! The best thing is that it has a great view of the port!",55
Best place to Stay in Naples,50,Date of stay: July 2018,"Modern, Chic property in the heart of Napoli. Great bars and restaurants. Rooms are very clean (no rug) and modern. Excellent views of the bay of Naples. Staff is attentive and professional. Recommended very good places to eat - off the beaten path non touristy. Breakfast was great as well. Stayed with my family and was treated like gold. We will be back.",70
Lovely pool and room,50,Date of stay: July 2018,The view from the rooftop pool is amazing. The pool is very relaxing with the bubbles. I tried all the different jets and watched the cruise ships come in and out. The immediate area around the hotel is very commercial. The lobby and the rooms are very modern. There were nice touches throughout like chocolates and bottled water. First class.,46
Very funky and luxury hotel,50,Date of stay: July 2018,A great spot for a city break in Naples. Very fancy modern rooms. Convenient location. Great view of the port. Friendly staff. Definitely recommended. Can’t think of what else to say to have 200 characters in this review. The place is great!,11
Amazing Service and Accommodations,50,Date of stay: July 2018,This hotel is within a 5 minute walk from the ferry ports and a 20 minute taxi ride to the airport. Our room was amazing and the service was great. We were able to check-in early and because we had to leave so early in the morning to catch a flight they packed up breakfast for us and delivered it to our room. The pool was relaxing with a view of the port and the city. We also had dinner at the restaurant and it was very nice.,59
"Wonderful, modern hotel",50,Date of stay: July 2018,"Spa was exceptional, the hotel was modern and very nice. This is the perfect place to stay when visiting Naples. We had a quick visit and did not want to even leave the hotel vicinity. Truly a beautiful property.",1
"Poor location and service, but great pool and spa.",20,Date of stay: July 2018,"The hotel decor is lovely, the room was great, the rooftop pool is amazing and the spa and gym are one of the best I have experienced, but there were some downsides to the hotel. Service was lacking - often we waited quite a long time for food and drinks. The pool is modern and relaxing, but there was no food or drink service, and I had to ask for a towel twice which was finally brought an hour and a half later. As other people have mentioned, there are some shady people around, so the location is unusual for a high-end hotel. And it is quite a walk to anywhere you may want to go. We had also managed to forget to book breakfast when we booked online at home in the New Zealand, and we emailed asking if we could have a reduced rate for this added on to our booking. We checked on…",19
Superb service at a beautiful hotel,50,Date of stay: July 2018,"From the moment we arrived the service we received was excellent- the staff were genuinely interested and helped with every query. The decor in the hotel is fab, there is something interesting everywhere you look and the quality of the room is what you would expect of a luxury hotel with little extras like handmade chocolates on arrival. The rooftop pool was perfect to relax in and the snacks served with our wine at the bar were excellent. If you are in Naples treat yourself and spend some time here :)",21
Nice hotel in an excellent location,50,Date of stay: July 2018,We selected this hotel for its location close to the ferry docks and the city historic center. It turned out to be an excellent choice. We took several day trips on ferries as well as traveled to Capri for a stay and they are right across the street. The walk to many historic sights and shopping is very easy. Taxi ride to promenade very short. The staff were all great and very helpful. The room was clean and modern. My only complaint would be that I would have preferred a little larger bathroom with 2 sinks.,465
Beautifully appointed hotel with helpful staff,50,Date of stay: July 2018,"Unfortunately, we only spent less than 8 hours at the hotel. The hotel was beautiful. The rooms were very comfortable. There was lots of lovely lighting in the room, but it was very difficult to figure out how to turn it all off at the end of the evening. Yes, there was a very small paper instruction we found after fiddling on our own for 10 minutes, but it was super tiny. The staff was very thoughtful. We had to leave at 4am. They offered to have breakfast packed for us, and it was just lovely for our long flight ahead. We would stay here again in a minute. Great hotel.",3
Exceeded my Expectations!,50,Date of stay: July 2018,"Staying at this hotel, I had high expectations, but my stay exceeded my expectations. Every staff person encountered were excellent. The hotel was immaculate, and the rooms were terrific. We had 2 dining experiences which were both very good. Can't say enough about this place.",1
A 1 night experience,40,Date of stay: July 2018,"Warm & friendly welcome. We didn't have our passports with us but I had my driving license which the hotel accepted and my partner only had her Carte De sejour which they didn't accept. We had to spend some time to find a copy of her passport which was a pain considering we were only staying for 1 night and wanted to relax. Cocktails and food was very good. We arrived at the spa 15 mins early, the welcome wasn't friendly, we were happy to wait but at least give a warm welcome or politely ask ask to come back in 15 minutes. Why is it that every single hotel mini bar is super expensive. The prices are outrageous!! why do hotels do this??? We spent a lot of money for the room and I hate being ripped off for the mini bar. The hotel industry needs to stop this.",1
From PR,50,Date of stay: June 2018,"Loved it! Like the details, awesome breakfast and service. Architecture, rooms and definitely concierge service the best! What else can I tell you, it is out of the norm from traditional hotels in Naples",1
Great luxury hotel,50,Date of stay: August 2017,"This hotel has an amazing and beautiful interior, you'll see it from the minute you walk into the reception. Statues, waterfalls and sleek design. The rooms are grand and the bathroom/shower is great. I liked the view from the room, but the hallways were a little dark.",374
Lavish; Without Reason,40,Date of stay: June 2018,"When you enter the hotel there is a fountain with hands around the edges. No real purpose. There is a samurai next to the elevator. Doesn't really make sense. Other than the random displays of modern art, this hotel was wonderful. Unfortunately, we didn't get to use the pool but we did take advantage of the beautiful breakfast buffet. It is expensive though. The wide layout of pastries, fruits and other impressive delicacies is truly impressive though. The rooms are nice despite the fact that the view is over an industrial port, where the cruise ships port. The hotel is in a strange area stuck in between the port, and the New Castle alongside the rest of the historical quarter of Naples. Near that New Castle there is construction which makes walking more inconvenient but that's…",114
Surprise birthday trip,50,Date of stay: March 2018,From the start when talking to the hotel about booking a room for my husband's surprise birthday trip the staff at the hotel could not have been more helpful. I ordered some fizz and also a prosecco cake for our arrival and the hotel were pained to ensure they timed this right with our check in to ensure everything was cold (and in tact) when we arrived. During our stay nothing was too much trouble and all the staff were lovely. I would also definitely recommend making use of the spa facilities and booking in for a message as both were lovely. Our room was beautiful with all the facilities we needed and a gorgeous view out over the bay of Naples. Thank you for helping me make this birthday trip special.,4
Honeymoon,50,Date of stay: June 2018,"We loved the hotel! We stayed here for two nights at the end of our trip. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and the location was great! The entire hotel was very clean and very modern. The customer service was wonderful and we even had a box of chocolates and a complimentary bottle of champagne in our room when we arrived. We assume it was because we were on our honeymoon. It was very generous. We also enjoyed the turn down service at night. We were able to walk pretty much everywhere we wanted to go. The only thing that we weren’t thrilled about was that at night if someone got up to used the bathroom, the light inside the bathroom shined out into the room due to it being so open and modern with frosted glass walls. We would absolutely stay here again!",1
Contemporary hotel with very good service,40,Date of stay: June 2018,Only spent one night here at the end of our Italy trip. Contemporary and chic decor with stunning public areas. Rooms were a bit smaller and more compact than some of the other 5 star hotels during our 2 week trip. A quick tip: the mirrored panel between the sink area and bedroom is a sliding panel that you can position for privacy in the shower. Location is very close to the Naples ferry terminal/cruise port and a short taxi to all other locations. Breakfast on the rooftop balcony overlooking the Bay of Naples with Sorrento in the distance is a wonderful way to start the day. A nice change of pace from the typical baroque/classical decor of most 5 star hotels.,179
Wonderful service experience,40,Date of stay: June 2018,"The hotel itself is reasonably nice, but the customer service experience was excellent. Everyone on the staff was warm, professional, and helpful. The food was also very good. I would stay again without hesitation.",1
Nice spot; poor service,30,Date of stay: June 2018,"The hotel is lovely, if you need to catch a ferry, the location is great, but the service leaves much to be desired. We waited 20mins to even be given a menu, it seemed like the staff could not be bothered to do their jobs. The pool is modern and relaxing, but there was no service, we finally had someone bring us towels after almost an hour. It’s a shame as it is a missed opportunity to sell drinks and poolside snacks, if they gave the area any thought (those items are available, just no service). The spa is GREAT, with wonderful hot and cold plunges; a Turkish bath; and saunas.",68
Naples Surprise,40,Date of stay: June 2018,"Great Hotel that is well priced with two very good restaurants. Location allows you excellent access to the old city and it many surprises both food wise and sight seeing. It also allows easy access to the Pallonetto area which fabulous and a must. Using Naples and the Romeo Hotel as a base to explore the Herculaneum, Pompey, Amalfi, Capri and other areas of the Gulf of Naples is well worth considering.",26
"Hotel Romeo , Naples",50,Date of stay: June 2018,Great 5 star hotel in the centre of Naples Excellent decor with great Art themes throughout -rooftop bar and pool are great Ultra modern feel with spa on -1 floor which is one of the best I’ve seen 3 hydro pools and multi saunas Food in restaurants a little limited and quite expensive,41
Great Hotel & Location,50,Date of stay: June 2018,"Excellent hotel near good restaurants and bars you can walk to. Top dinning room and pool have a great view of Mt. Visuvius. Staff is attentive and friendly, made good recommendations to our group for dinning, cars and tours.",12
The go to Hotel when in Naples,50,Date of stay: May 2018,"Wonderful experience. Spa is a must. Food is fabulous. Service extremely customer focused. Great place for a night or two. Across for port of Naples. Great view of Bay of Naples have stayed here many times in the past. Has always been great spot to sleep, recover from long flights, or just chill.",17
